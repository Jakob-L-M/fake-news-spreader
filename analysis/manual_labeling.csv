If you were to come to grips with the uncomfortable reality of how often innocent people are falsely convicted of heinous crimes, how biased the American ""justice"" systems is (just look at the politicization of THE SUPREME COURT, you don't think that happens at lower levels? Some judge who's up for re-election wanting to look tough on crime? or who just believes QAnon bullshit? Or has a religious or racial bias? look at the red scare, or the satanic panic for evidence of the justice system losing its goddamned mind entirely ) ... you might change your stance.  Besides that, the basic science is, death has proven ineffective as a deterrent and may cause more murders as criminals are more likely to kill witnesses.   To your point too it frequently costs the state more to kill someone than to keep them in prison for life, so even if you're putting money over lives... keep them in jail. (and it's not completely clear cut, it doesn't make intuitive sense, and raises a lot of ""but if things were different... Because it 'shouldn't' cost more to kill someone than keep them in jail' but tough shit, that's the situation we have to work with ) https://ballotpedia.org/Fact_check/Is_the_death_penalty_more_expensive_than_life_in_prison  New evidence comes to light all the time, corrupt judges are found out, laws change, and you can always release people from prison, but you can't releases someone from the grave. That and the described frequently inhuman way many death row inmates are killed because even big pharma won't play along with execution as a punishment."

Secondly, the rioters that attacked the Capitol and have subsequently been arrested have claimed that the president asked for them to be there - so at some level his speech is encouraging physical attacks.  Thirdly, the actual speech: [https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial)  His speech is not about calming people down and accepting defeat gracefully. He repeatedly (and falsely) claims the election is stolen. He repeatedly claims that ""we"" are not going to take this anymore.  Fourthly, during Trump's speech, the audience chanted ""Fight for Trump"" - and he didn't tell them to be peaceful (NB: He uses the words Fight/Fighting 20 times).  **He got people riled up and directed them to march on the Capitol.**"

EDIT: Also  &gt;AstraZeneca previously said it will not profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic and has stated prices ranging from $3 to $4 per dose—the lowest price announced for a potential COVID-19 vaccine so far. However, terms of a deal with AstraZeneca disclosed by the Financial Times show that there are limits to AstraZeneca’s public “no profit” commitments, and that __the company has given itself the power to declare the pandemic over as soon as July 2021.__ This means that, after July 2021—a time when the pandemic is expected to still be impacting people’s lives all over the world—AstraZeneca could charge governments and other purchasers like MSF high prices for a vaccine that was entirely funded by taxpayer money. Furthermore, it was revealed that AstraZeneca may charge as much as 20 percent more than the costs associated with producing the vaccine.  https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/msf-calls-astrazeneca-honor-no-profit-pricing-promise-covid-19-vaccine"

If you ask people ""will you be willing to do X"" or ""will you be willing to pay Y"" then most people say no.  &gt; A large majority of Washington state residents believe climate change is happening and understand that humans are to blame. But, even as the state passed a measure to tighten gun control and supported congressional Democrats, voters clearly rejected a chance to take a bold step with a first-in-the-nation carbon tax.  &gt; https://time.com/5447748/washington-state-carbon-tax-climate-change/  Everyone loves to act like climate change is an opportunity and that fighting it is only going to bring jobs and prosperity to everyone. It's not true. It's a catastrophe that needs to be fixed. Yeah, some people will be hired to fix it. That costs money. That means higher taxes.  This is not a good thing. Solving climate change is going to suck and it's going to require scarifies. But we have to do it anyways.  If going carbon neutral was cheaper, we would have already done it. And don't anyone dare say that solar is cheaper than gas because at the end of the day you need to calculate 24 hours of solar (i.e. solar+storage) vs 24 hours of gas and that's much more expensive."

DeJoy already [said](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/retreat-dejoy-suspends-usps-changes-until-after-election-n1237140) they’d halt the changes and stated they would be delayed until after the election.   &gt;In blocking DeJoy’s changes, U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian said the USPS changes amounted to “a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service,” and there is “a substantial possibility many voters will be disenfranchised.”  This is all conjecture and is not proven.   &gt;The specifics of the injunction are not yet released, but the AGs’ request for a preliminary injunction specifically asked the court to stop a directive requiring mail trucks to leave on time—which has resulted in mail getting left behind—require the USPS to treat all election mail as first class mail and require all sorting equipment that has been removed or disconnected to be reimplemented.  Can’t argue with specifics that aren’t released now can we?  But why stop trucks from leaving on time? Why is that an issue? Don’t we expect a service to be on time?  As far as being able to handle mail-in ballots, the post office has stated they are fully [capable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-11/postal-service-can-handle-a-surge-of-mail-in-ballots-u-s-says) of doing so.   &gt;The injunction also asked the USPS to “abide by” a recent directive from DeJoy that temporarily paused some of his changes through the election.  Noted above. This changes nothing that wasn’t already happening.   &gt;DeJoy has repeatedly defended his changes to the agency and insisted the USPS has the capacity to handle election mail, and the postmaster general reiterated his commitment to running trucks on time in a video to USPS employees released Thursday hours before the ruling.  And again, already addressed above.   So this case was basically just a political statement to accuse DeJoy of playing politics with the mail?"

Example:  [The CIA threat to journalists that wasn't](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/the-truth-about-the-wikileaks-cia-cache.html). Wikileaks posts a tweet saying that CIA malware can ""bypass"" a common way of securing communications via encryption. Journalists then reported this as saying the CIA could *break* that encryption method. There was a CIA malware tool, but it did not target encrypted communication at all. It targeted the information held on an individual phone. The more accurate summary would have been ""If the C.I.A. goes after your specific phone and hacks it, the agency can look at its content."".  How many ""revelations"" from Wikileaks are like this? I think pretty much all of them, personally."

Most gun violence is gang related in cities with the most restricive infringements of our rights.  From hitemlow:  Here's my usual dump, should make a decent starting point.  The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America  Rifles killed 297 people last year. That's ANY type of rifle and ANY instance in which it was used - whether that be home defense, gang activity, mass shootings, etc.  Fists and feet killed 700.  Knives killed 1,500.  Guns aren't the problem, especially rifles  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls  There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)  U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)  Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.  Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.  What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:  • 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)  • 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)  • 489 (2%) are accidental (5)  So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.  Still too many? Let's look at location:  298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)  327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)  328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)  764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)  That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.  This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others  Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...  But what about other deaths each year?  70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)  49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)  37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)  Now it gets interesting:  250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!  610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).  A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.  Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!  We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.  Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.  https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15  Page 15:  Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).  That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including suicides. (Which account for over 75% of all deaths by gun  Older study, 1995:  https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc  Page 164  The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns.

[Here's a Breitbart article from **yesterday** that claims that Obama had wire tapped Trump Tower.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/mark-levin-obama-used-police-state-tactics-undermine-trump/amp/)  The arguments it makes are very dubious and it comes to a solid conclusion based on sources that really only offer hearsay, and even the conclusions of their sources are very dubious.  One of the most important sources appears to be [this National Review article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443768/obama-fisa-trump-wiretap) which doesn't come to anything like the conclusion that Breitbart ends up making (surprise, surprise).  Breitbart claims that there is evidence that the FBI were eavesdropping on the Trump campaign whereas the National Review article claims the FBI had a limited warrant to listen to specific communication from Trump Tower not including Trump himself's communication. (They make the claim that the FISA warrant is directed at the mysterious server contacting Russia that has now become infamous).  (As an aside to this I'm also going to postulate that Trump had a busy day yesterday and didn't find enough time to binge the news so took an opportunity to do that this morning. His other tweets around the same time are also making reference to topics that were raised by news articles yesterday, such as [the Russian ambassador having made 22 visits to the White House.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/russian-ambassador-visited-obama-white-house-22-times/amp/) Either or that or Bannon is getting news fed to him by his former employees and is whispering it in Trump's ear)  Edit: Just to give people my theorised timeline of Trump's morning:  Just beore 3:30 in the morning Trump read [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/state-department-sponsored-sessions-meeting-with-russian-ambassador/) article from Breitbart. He decided to take the opportunity to clear Sessions' name and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837987684660412416) at 3:26am.  He then skimmed through [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/state-department-sponsored-sessions-meeting-with-russian-ambassador/) article from Breitbart. He was outraged by it and had to [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106) about it at 3:35am. (For those claiming that this was obviously from Trump's investigations into FISA warrants and not from Breitbart, why in the world would Trump not tweet about this when he was made aware of it? And why the hell would he send a tweet in defence of Sessions before tweeting about this?)  He then flicked through to [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/russian-ambassador-visited-obama-white-house-22-times) article from Breitbart and has to [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106) out his defence of Sessions again at 3:42am.  But he was still outraged by the second story and sent out tweets number [four](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837993273679560704), [five](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837994257566863360) and [six](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837996746236182529) between 3:49am and 4:02 am.  He then calmed down for a bit and came back for some [celebrity news](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/03/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-quits-celebrity-apprentice-one-season-cites-shows-baggage/) and had to let off some steam by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/838016045222854656) that Schwarzenegger was fired from the Apprentice rather than quit at 5:19am. Not sure what happened in the hour long gap between tweets.

I said, and he gets it, culturally there are different norms in each country, and their leaders are expected to follow.”*   It's a little bit of word salad, true, but  Biden is not forgiving Xi Jinping because persecution of the Uighurs is in keeping with Chinese cultural norms. He’s warning Xi Jinping that he will be pressuring China over these things because to do so is in keeping with American cultural norms.

The mink farms got millions infected with covid, they passed it among one another. It mutated and returned to humans.   &gt; Since June 2020, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks, including 12 cases with a unique variant, reported on 5 November. All 12 cases were identified in September 2020 in North Jutland, Denmark. The cases ranged in age from 7 to 79 years, and eight had a link to the mink farming industry and four cases were from the local community.  Initial observations suggest that the clinical presentation, severity and transmission among those infected are similar to that of other circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. However, this variant, referred to as the ""cluster 5"" variant, had a combination of mutations, or changes that have not been previously observed. The implications of the identified changes in this variant are not yet well understood. Preliminary findings indicate that this particular mink-associated variant identified in both minks and the 12 human cases has moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Further scientific and laboratory-based studies are required to verify preliminary findings reported and to understand any potential implications of this finding in terms of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in development. In the meantime, actions are being taken by Danish authorities to limit the further spread of this variant of the virus among mink and human populations.  https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-november-2020-mink-associated-sars-cov2-denmark/en/  &gt; In fact, in 2007 an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health was published on the topic, worrying that our mass-raising and slaughtering of animals for food could be the genesis of the next big global pandemic. Given the connection between industrial animal agriculture and pandemic risk, the American Public Health Association journal editorial observed: “It is curious, therefore, that changing the way humans treat animals—most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten—is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.""  https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/one-root-cause-of-pandemics-few-people-think-about/"

Here's a few examples to get you started:  * After decades of tolerating and defending predators like Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein, launching the #MeToo campaign to derail a SCOTUS nominee with zero evidence and no due process, but then abandoning it when Biden is mired in much more substantial allegations.  * Demanding strict gun control or total disarmament while being protected by armed guards. * Pushing global warming alarmism and demanding everyone live ascetic lifestyles while private jetting their hairdresser in.  * Shilling for higher taxes while dodging your personal taxes, such as docking your yacht in another state.  * Left wing environmental protesters leaving sites covered in trash. * Claiming to support tolerance but seeking to silence any conservative voices through censorship and intimidation. * Antifa violently attacking people and destroying property like brownshirt fascists, all with tacit approval of rest of the left * Supporting open borders and opposing a wall while building massive fences around their own homes and compounds. * Attacking the Covington kids ruthlessly, then demanding that their teen dropout activist be above criticism due to her age.  * Liberal colleges obsessed with social justice who systematically discriminate against Asians in admissions.  I could write a book on this. You would be hard pressed to find a single issue on the left that isn't fraught with hypocrisy.

No out for child support forces a man to spend years of his life working to pay for a child he does not want.  If he loses his job and is unable to pay, he will be locked in a cage.  1 in 8 men in South Carolina jails are there for failure to pay child support. They are not given court appointed lawyers until they are $10k behind and most are arrested and lose their job way before that limit making it extremely difficult to pay.  Src: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/skip-child-support-go-to-jail-lose-job-repeat.html  In the US,  &gt; 66 percent of all child support not paid by fathers is due to an inability to come up with the money  Src: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-myth-of-the-deadbeat-_b_4745118   After [Hermesmann v Seyer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer) set the precedent, courts around the country have decided that male victims of women owe the perpetrators child support for decades, while other precedents (Roe v Wade) and laws (safe haven laws) generally allow female victims many options to get rid of the product of their rapes.  &gt; Hermesmann successfully argued that a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman.  E.g.  Alabama man - https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-civil/1996/2950025-0.html  Arizona boy - https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/  California boy - https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-12-22-9612220045-story.html  Others in this paper ""Victims with responsibilities"" -https://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=cflj  There are many others out there. I do not believe there has yet been a single case where a boy or man has gotten out of paying child support to an adult woman that statutory raped, raped, sperm jacked, etc.  The good news is that in recent years feminist lobbiests have pushed for laws to prevent rapists from getting child custody. Without custody the child wouldn't be raised by a rapist and the victim wouldn't owe child support. So the day that a male doesn't owe his perpetrator may be coming soon. The less good news is that just over half the states that passed these laws passed them as the feminist lobbiests proposed them - only preventing rapist **fathers** from getting custody.

From your first article:   &gt;	Yes. Under the new legislation, it is illegal for anyone except poll workers to provide food or water to voters in line for polls.  &gt;	The law reads: “No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method...or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector.”  &gt;	“This prohibition is a part of a number of different prohibitions that make it more difficult to do politicking at the polls,” Segall explained.   &gt;	But Segall says it’s very unlikely that this law will be enforced.  Yes it is illegal for anyone who is not a poll works to hand out food or water to voters in line, but as a way to keep people from attempting to garner more votes by doing so. They also still allow unmanned water stations (water fountains, etc.) at polling locations. Poll workers could still go out and hand out snacks or water if it was a need.   No one is going to be punished if they’re standing in line and they have a bottle of water and they hand it to their friend that came with them.   And I don’t see people having to bring their own provisions as a barrier to voting.   &gt;	 This means regardless of absentee ballots, single parents and working class have to schedule time off work if they work Mon-Friday, 9-5. This reduces the availability of drop box hours to 25% what it was in 2020.  “However, the law did make some changes to early voting. But experts say the net effect was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them.”  “One of the biggest changes in the bill would expand early voting access for most counties, adding an additional mandatory Saturday and formally codifying Sunday voting hours as optional,” Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting said in an excellent and comprehensive report on the impact of the new law. “Counties can have early voting open as long as 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at minimum. If you live in a larger metropolitan county, you might not notice a change. For most other counties, you will have an extra weekend day, and your weekday early voting hours will likely be longer.”  “During the 2020 election, for instance, vote-rich Fulton County, with a substantial Black population, set early-voting hours at 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on most weekdays and two Saturdays, though the last weekdays had 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. voting hours. Voting was allowed on two Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m.”  “Under the new law, Fulton County could set the exact same hours for in-person early voting — or expand them from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day.”  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/biden-falsely-claims-new-georgia-law-ends-voting-hours-early/  Yes the number of boxes are drastically decreased which is inconvenient I can concede to that, but it also opens up a mandatory Saturday with an optional Sunday for early voting which opens the available drop boxes on those days as well. With extended early voting, there may not be as much of a need for said boxes.    I can’t read your last 2 articles because of paywalls but based on what you’re saying I can see why those would seem like knee jerk reactions to losing an election. Although I think that even with the reduction in times regarding the absentee ballets, I think the limits are still plenty and don’t really pose any unfair advantage, though I can see why people might not like a reduction in time of any amount.   Just like with every law of course there are going to be issues with it, but it is not the Jim Crow era policy that Biden is trying to make it out to be.   If people argued against it from the last two angles I’d be a little more understanding but the argument I see 99% of the time is against requiring an ID to vote."

However, even this weaker claim is false. It just isn’t true that black men are kicked, punched, etc., on a regular basis by the police.  In order to show that, I’m going to use data from the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), which, as its name suggests, provides detailed information about contacts between the police and the public. It’s conducted on a regular basis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and is based on a nationally representative sample of more than 70,000 U.S. residents age 16 or older. Respondents are asked whether they had a contact with the police during the past 12 months; if they say they did, they answer a battery of questions about the nature of their last contact, including any use of force. Since the respondents also provide their age, race, gender, etc., we can use this survey to calculate the prevalence of police violence for various demographic groups. The numbers in this piece are from my own analysis of the data, the details and code for which I provide here, but they are consistent with a 2015 report compiled by the BJS itself to the extent the two overlap.  First, despite what the narrative claims, it’s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason. Indeed, black men are less likely than white men to have contact with the police in any given year, though this includes situations where the respondent called the cops himself: 17.5 percent versus 20.7 percent. Similarly, a black man has on average only 0.32 contacts with the police in any given year, compared with 0.35 contacts for a white man. It’s true that black men are overrepresented among people who have many contacts with the police, but not by much. Only 1.5 percent of black men have more than three contacts with the police in any given year, whereas 1.2 percent of white men do.  If we look at how often the police use physical force against men of different races, we find that there is indeed a racial disparity, but that this experience is rare across the board. Only 0.6 percent of black men experience physical force by the police in any given year, while approximately 0.2 percent of white men do. To be fair, these are probably slight undercounts, because the survey does not allow us to identify people who did not experience physical force during their most recent contact but did experience such force during a previous contact in the same year.  Further, physical force as defined by the PPCS includes relatively mild forms of violence such as pushing and grabbing. Actual injuries by the police are so rare that one cannot estimate them very precisely even in a survey as big as the PPCS, but the available data suggest that only 0.08 percent of black men are injured by the police each year, approximately the same rate as for white men. A black man is about 44 times as likely to suffer a traffic-related injury, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Moreover, keep in mind that these tallies of police violence include violence that is legally justified.  Now, it’s true that there are significant differences in the rates at which men of different races experience police violence — 0.6 percent is triple 0.2 percent. However, although people often equate racial disparities with bias, this inference is fallacious, as can be seen through an analogy with gender: Men are vastly more likely to experience police violence than women are, but while bias may explain part of this disparity, nobody doubts that most of it has to do with the fact that men are on average far more violent than women. Similarly, if black men commit violent crimes at much higher rates than white men, that might have a lot to do with the disparity in the use of force by the police.  This is evident in the National Crime Victimization Survey, another survey of the public conducted by the BJS. Interviewers ask respondents if they have been the victim of a crime in the past 12 months; if they have, respondents provide information about the nature of the incidents, including the race and ethnicity of the offenders. This makes it possible to measure racial differences in crime rates without relying on data from the criminal-justice system, in which racial bias could lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction for black men even if they commit violence at the same rate.  NCVS data from 2015, the most recent year available, suggest that black men are three times as likely to commit violent crimes as white men. To the extent that cops are more likely to use force against people who commit violent crimes, which they surely are, this could easily explain the disparities we have observed in the rates at which the police use force. That’s not to say that bias plays no role; I’m sure it does play one. But it’s unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy.  Some might say that, instead of consulting statistics like these, we should defer to black Americans’ own perceptions of how the police treat them. As various polls have demonstrated, black people are much more likely than white people to think that police violence against minorities is very common. But the issue cannot be settled this way.  Since individuals have direct knowledge of what happened to them personally, you can trust them about that. But when it comes to larger social phenomena, people’s beliefs are influenced by far more than just their personal experience, including the media. The far more compelling fact is that, if you draw a representative sample of the population and ask each black man in that sample whether a police officer has used physical force against him in the past year, you find that it’s extremely rare.”  https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/the-institutional-racism-canard/   https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=14    https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/06/03/bob_woodson_democrats_use_racism_to_deflect_attention_from_failing_cities_theyve_run_for_50_years.html"

Read on.***    &gt; It is abundantly clear that if the present-day vaccine climate, namely, **that everyone must comply with the CDC's one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule or be labeled a health risk to society at large**, is to succumb to open and balanced discussion, it is the [peer-reviewed biomedical evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=vaccine) itself that is going to pave the way towards making rational debate on the subject happen.  &gt; With this aim in mind, [GreenMedInfo.com has painstakingly collected over 300 pages of study abstracts](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download) culled directly from the National Library of Medicine's [**pubmed.gov**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=vaccine) bibliographic database on the wide-ranging adverse health effects linked to vaccines in the today's schedule ([**over 200 distinct adverse effects, including death**](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all)), as well as numerous studies related to vaccine contamination, and [**vaccine failure** ](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/keyword/vaccine-failure)in highly vaccine compliant populations.

Period,"" Dai said.  &gt; Allison Winnike, president of the Texas-based Immunization Partnership, an organization providing advocacy and information about immunization initiatives, said that Moderna benefited tremendously from Operation Warp Speed, in part, by receiving close to $1 billion to support its vaccine development and clinical trials.  Now, let's talk Pfizer:  &gt; ""Pfizer is a very large company with substantial cash reserves,"" Goodman said. ""I'm sure that [OWS] was helpful. I'm not sure about [whether] it wouldn't have happened without it.""  &gt; Walter Orenstein, a former director of the U.S. Immunization Program and former deputy director for immunization programs at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, said Operation Warp Speed has played a major role by guaranteeing a market to Pfizer so it can begin developing its procedures for distribution.  &gt; He agreed that the policy initiative is an exception to how the Trump administration has handled the pandemic and that his ""personal opinion is [OWS] has helped substantially.""  &gt; ""I can't see this large an effort by this many companies going forward in this fashion without substantial support that has come [through] Operation Warp Speed.""  Of course OWS and Pfizer don't have a perfect relationship, but please stop saying they have no involvement or didn't help. *You* might say they didn't help based on your personal perception of what is truly ""helpful,"" but if the experts are saying it helped, then obviously I'm going to take their word over your opinion."

Rape, incest and mother's well-being (safe, legal and rare) have been heralded by pro-abortion advocates forever and a day, as a means to push for taxpayer funded abortion-on-demand, of which the majority (74%) are listed as being 'disruptive to the mothers life.' They will continue to tout those three 'exceptions' for as long as we cede those few precious lives, and use them to press for an ever more radical agenda.

Even if you taxed the wealthy at 100%, it would not be enough money for a fraction of the Trillions of Dollars that are being spent.   Plus, who do you think the wealthy are? They are the ""elite"" and the politicians who are bought by the elite.  If you are thinking about taxing corporations, they simply pass the increased costs into the price of their products. It is a reality that corporations DON'T pay taxes, their customers do.  People making 500k a year are taxed at the same PERCENT, not the same amount.  A 40% tax on $40,000.00 is $16,000.00.  A 40% tax on $500,000.00 is $200,000.00.  A 40% tax on $2,000,000.00 is $500,000.00.  Do you seriously believe that that is an equivalent?

Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test  ”without having virus material available” 1  “relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” 2  2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?  Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:  “...the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%” 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31, 32, 39, 40, 44, 45  ”It is spreading like fire,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, they all seem to be asymptomatic.” 27  BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms” 28, 29, 30, 31  ”NFL has 77 apparently false positive coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” 41  3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis  ”They get more money if those patients are then put on ventilators.” 3, 4, 5  ”Once again the old adage — follow the money — and we saw that if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission payment through the CARES Act.” 49  He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that perverse incentives have been created.” -Sen. Scott Jensen  4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...  Creating false positives and negatives. 15, 16, 17,  18, 47  ”...all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.” 46  5. Cook the Books  ”...classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.” 19, 20, 21, 36, 37, 38  Count Death by:  •	⁠Motorcycle accident 22 •	⁠Car accident 23 •	⁠Ladder falls 24 •	⁠Suicides and murders 25  Gunshots?  ”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” 43  ”Tennessee woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19” 26  If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.  Dr. Genevieve Briand states:  “If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.” 33 34 35  Note: Johns Hopkins pulled Dr. Genevieve Briand’s study.

And I thought I would post this here as its a good time to discuss something called Gamma Bias, which I am sure most people would not have heard of, and is useful to now when considering identity politics and SJW's as it explains a lot of they motivations.  SO....  The new report: (lol its not by dailymail, its a study, but im linking daily mail)  [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment)  The original claim (women leaders better handled pandemic which was falsely claimed by a study then cited bu UN, WEF, Times, Guardian, BBC, etc) was:  1. Entirely false to being with 2. Due to Gamma Bias  # 1) entirely false to being with  See here, not only did female leaders, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse:  See here, not only did female leaders do worse than male ones, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse: (correlation more women in parliament = worse outcomes)  In summary:  * The median death per capita rate in female-led countries is 60.3 per million. The median death per capita rate in male-led countries is 17.8 per million (Mann-Whitney U test p-value 0.053). * The median death rate per capita in countries with national parliaments with at least 40% women is 59.7 per million. The median death rate per capita in countries with national parliaments with less than 40% women is 17.9 per million (Mann-Whitney U test p-value 0.048).  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self\_according\_to\_european\_cdc\_and\_oxford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/idz5ih/self_according_to_european_cdc_and_oxford/)  To be clear, to me with a brain THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN... there are countless factors, but it makes it even more hilarious those agenda drive fake researchers tried to say women did better, when they literally did worse. And even if it was due to women as a class, that would still make no difference, as you aways judge individuals, not group identity.  The study saying otherwise was absurd in its logical gymnastics to try and paint a false picture:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental\_analysis\_flaws\_underlying\_just\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental_analysis_flaws_underlying_just_about/)  # 2) The reason: due to Gamma bias (useful to know about SJWs)  [https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/)  Within the “celebration” cell, for example, the positive achievements of women are routinely celebrated as a gender issue. Within the same cell in the table, the positive actions and achievements of men are not similarly celebrated or gendered. For example, when a group of boys was recently rescued from dangerous underwater caves in Thailand, it was not reported as a gender issue or as a positive example of masculinity, despite the fact that all the rescuers were male.  In the “victimhood” cell, domestic violence against women, for example, is highlighted as a gender issue, whereas domestic violence against men is played down or completely ignored, despite the [substantial numbers of male victims](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9194-1). When men make up the majority of victims (e.g. suicide, rough sleeping, deaths at work, addiction), the issues are not highlighted or portrayed as gender issues.  Within the “privilege” cell, male privileges are magnified in our media and politics as “patriarchy” whereas female privileges (for example relating to children and family life) are played down or ignored as gender issues.  The overall impact of gamma bias therefore, according to this hypothesis, is that masculinity is made to look significantly worse than it really is whilst simultaneously femininity is made to look significantly better than it really is.  What are the implications of the routine magnifying of the worst of men and minimising the worst of women? Well, for a start we might need to reconceptualise the ‘crisis of masculinity’ as a crisis in our attitudes towards men and masculinity.  Let’s make 2019 the year we wake up to the need to explore our conscious and unconscious biases against men. We hope that the concept of gamma bias and the *gender distortion matrix* will help people to think more clearly about gender issues."

Lee to another name.”  After another question at that press conference, Trump became even more explicit: **“I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.”**  &gt;Oh and Trump offers to pay the legal bills of people to beat up journalists at his rally. Cool.  You mean, ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,""?   So Trump offered to pay the legal fees for someone stopping an attempted assault.    Threatening violence isn't protected speech, so if he did call for violence it would be very easy for a judge to find him guilty in a court of law. Except that hasn't happened.   Meanwhile you had a Bernie Bro shoot a Republican while screaming about taking away healthcare, right after Bernie said that the Republican healthcare program will ""kill people."" And you have an AOC-loving antifa member shoot at and bomb an ICE facility after AOC made her comments about it. And Maxine Walters saying they need to ""make them feel not welcome"" sure isn't alluding to her followers to be peaceful."

Does something need to be done? Yeah. Sure. And not because we should be because we can. Does any form of international or national government need to control it? Fuck No! They need to get out of the way and let industries do it on their own. Their customers want it...so they are doing it.  Will the drops in green house gasses change the upcoming and basically scheduled global temperature increases? Probably not...my opinion, and some others also.  What more can be done? Expand the use of national gas for all transportation including cars and retrofitting existing vehicles is not expensive and fairly easy to do. Plant more trees and MAKE countries with rain forest stop deforestation.   We can't let the country become like California with its rolling black outs cause they don't have the power stations or infrastructure to handle it, not without cause massive wildfires from 1) poor line management and 2) California becoming so eco friendly that they stopped managing with natural areas with scheduled burns and basic firebreaks.  But many of the scientific stuff you read or listen to say there is much more we can do and my sources say we can do some but let's not ruin an economy, any or many industries, or lower the standard of living.  You can keep posting links as well as I can. Bring information and insight is good for any discussion.   Your link said coal plants are really bad. And they are. One, maybe more of mine say the same but add that many plants have switched over to using natural gas in the last few years. This so much better then using coal or oil.   But the climate nuts cry out that these still put out too much pollution. And they never want to hear how many windmills or solar panels it will take to switch over completely to ""renewable"" sources. Or how long it would take to: build enough of both, manufacture the batteries needed, build the infrastructure for all these massive numbers of panels and mills. They just want it done NOW! Fuck the cost. Fuck the time line. Fuck facts. Just turn it all off NOW!  And of course we can't build anymore nuclear plants or damn anymore rivers, oh hell NO! So while the nuke plants we have get older and no new dams built well be a country completely relying on having enough sun and wind AND the new power lines to move power across the country where there isn't sun or wind for a few days. Trillions of dollars...trillions that will be harder to come by with the shutting down of out oil fields, refineries, service stations, and delivery systems.  Moderate changes over reasonable time."

Going to submit to all of them online and in print!    \-----  Dear \[insert name of airline\],  There has been a lot of chatter and news articles about requiring a “vaccine” / making a covid shot mandatory for flying (“health passport”). I am writing you to share some thoughts about this.  As a \[insert name of airline\] customer I am horrified that airlines might make a COVID “vaccine” mandatory to fly. A vaccine that uses a new mRNA technology. Untested in the long term &amp; unproven. Larger scale efficacy / safety data was based off testing of only a few months – and in the summer/early fall when immune systems are still strong.  The risk of ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and other mid/long term side effects / harm cannot be ruled out. The adverse reaction rate is also much higher than other ""vaccines.""  Even if there is acceptable safety data in the next two to three years, this is not a reason to require a “vaccine” – which will likely need to be readministered on an annual basis. I’ve attached a CDC past flu vaccine efficacy chart and some shocking disclaimers present on every flu shot warning label, which might make you wonder if the historical flu shot even prevents flu.  Many frequent travelers such as myself have learned how to stay healthy by understanding natural health principles – like flying to sunny places in the winter to get good old fashioned sun for a healthy immune system / Vitamin D.  Taking a shot goes against this idea.  Lastly, we come to COVID itself, which has a 99%+ survivability rate (related to IFR) for those under 70 – per CDC. And \~97%+ for those over 70 and not in a nursing home. While the IFR may change in the future, and while there is a risk of “long covid” for some, choosing whether to get an (annual) shot must remain a choice, not a requirement.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.  \---  IFR rate is on this CDC webpage – right most box   [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1)   Did diseases decline because of vaccines?

It was about how that can happen here.    Listen to the audio of Hillary.  She was placing about 1/2 the country in an “undesirable group” (“deplorables”).

He was called out for it, began lying, was called out again, then Warren agreed his response wasn't sufficient.  &gt;“Under your leadership as mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Indiana, was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident,” Davis said, invoking statistics first reported by The Intercept. “Now, that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state — in fact, it’s higher than the rest of the nation — and that disparity increased in South Bend after you took office. When talking about the problem on national terms, you’ve called it ‘evidence of systemic racism.’ You were mayor for eight years, so weren’t you, in effect, the head of the system? And how do you explain that increase in black arrests under your leadership?”  &gt;Buttigieg obfuscated, responding with statistics that didn’t address Davis’s question and avoiding the racial disparity on pot arrests. “Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average. And specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune. I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department. But we’ve got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies,” he said. “It’s great that everybody’s so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s?”  &gt;Davis reiterated her original question, pressing him to answer in a way moderators in previous debates have shied away from. Buttigieg began to respond by saying, “And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate.”  &gt;Then Davis cut him off to make a correction: “No, there was an increase,” she said. “The year before you were in office, it was lower. Once you became in office in 2012, that number went up. In 2018, the last number year that we have record for, that number was still up.”  &gt;Buttigieg seemed to concede Davis’s point and pivoted to blaming the elevated pot arrests of black people on “gun violence and gang violence.”  https://theintercept.com/2020/02/10/pete-buttigieg-black-marijuana-arrests/  Watch him get asked, a non answer, then called out for not answering during the NH debate  https://youtu.be/10HNtL0rhRE   More reporting https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/pete-buttigieg-faces-pressure-marijuana-arrests-black-people/story%3fid=68842579  https://theintercept.com/2019/11/26/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-marijuana-arrests/"

Firstly the recordings weren't lost, they only record for two months and the shop owner said he didn't realize it was Hunter Biden's laptop until after. Although the shop owner said the person that dropped it off identified themselves as Hunter Biden. They also dropped off 3 mac books with campaign stickers on them. The blindness comes in because he can't testify it was actually Hunter. Which no tapes to check by that time either.  He got in contact with the FBI, they subpoenaed them from him in december 2019, but not before backing up the harddrives to a separate drive. (Really can't speak to how legal that is, to make copies of something you're required to turn over to the FBI but it doesn't seem great)  Then provided them to Rudy, neither him nor Rudy will say who got in contact with the other first. (Idk about you but I wouldn't know the first steps for contacting Rudy to give him files) Rudy got them around the time of the impeachment hearings late 2019 (The shop owner says he gave it to Rudy after the FBI took it but Rudy has said repeatedly around the impeachment hearings which were starting in November. (Subpoena in mid dec)  One big thing left out of this summary is that a leak of Hunter Biden's personal data was found to have been on the market in 2019 around the time Rudy was sniffing around over there. There was said to be a collection of incriminating photos and personal information. There is no discrediting the validity of SOME of the pictures and information on the laptop. (Which some of it was clearly from a phone, not a laptop) But there's a lot of proof that some of the data from the laptop was for sale previously. A person who likes puzzles may put two and two together that the data could've been purchased, loaded into a laptop, slapped a campaign sticker on it, loaded in more incriminating ""evidence"", found a true believer who worked in laptop repair, and gave them the laptops.

Like pounds and pounds of weed, way too much for anyone to smoke... which means a lot gets given away... which also means people buy less weed.

Holy hell.   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/  I'm sorry to all the Sanders supporters that I've been telling it was a longshot but still winnable. I really didn't expect a drop like this *before* MI voted. I'm guessing this takes in to account recent polls which show Sanders struggling in MI (and other places).  In sure Sanders will want to stay in a bit longer - but it's definitely time to soften the attacks against Biden and focus on unity.  And no - to those who are going to want to instinctively disregard this - 538 isn't pulling numbers out of their asses - anyone who knows anything about statistics knows Nate Silver is as good as it gets and he'd never assign a score of effectively 0 to anything that has a snowball's chance in hell because it would hurt that reputation. His computer models are the best in the business IMO (and many other people far smarter than myself).  This really does look over.

And they don’t know if they might be on their own for a while if there is another attack.” NRA spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam later [told ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91807&amp;page=1): “It’s a natural feeling that after 9/11, people want to be proactive and take necessary actions to protect themselves and their loved ones in these uncertain times.”   &gt;   &gt;**2005: The NRA uses Hurricane Katrina to inflame fears of gun confiscation**    &gt;   &gt;During the days after the 2005 storm, New Orleans’s police superintendent decreed that “only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons” on the city’s ravaged, anarchic streets and officers were seen disarming some residents before they were evacuated. But a later review found that the New Orleans police had taken only [552](https://www.thetrace.org/2015/08/nra-hurricane-katrina-gun-confiscation/) guns into custody — a number that contrasts with the widespread, “door-to-door” confiscation that the NRA has claimed. Speaking to NPR at the time, LaPierre [said](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4956143): “I mean, the truth is never again can some politician look you in the eye and say with a straight face, ‘You don’t need a firearm because the government is going to be there to protect you.’ All you have to say is, ‘Remember New Orleans.'”   &gt;   &gt;**2012: The NRA seizes on another devastating storm to push guns to defend personal property**    &gt;   &gt;When Superstorm Sandy wreaked destruction on New York City, where gun laws are restrictive, LaPierre [mischaracterized](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hurricane-sandy-looting-cases-tossed-article-1.1204847) the aftermath in [an op-ed](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20130201/stand-and-fight) by exaggerating [incidents](http://mischaracterized/) of theft. “We saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia,” he said. “Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn … It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival.”   &gt;   &gt;**2017: The NRA turns political divisions into a call to arms**    &gt;   &gt;Following Trump’s inauguration, the NRA used speeches and its now defunct streaming channel to disseminate chaotic video clips that [framed](https://www.thetrace.org/2017/02/nra-wayne-lapierre-violent-left-media-cpac-trump/) liberal activists as a violent force that [posed](https://www.thetrace.org/2017/08/nra-violent-left-backfire/) a threat to gun-owning Americans. The NRA’s [campaign](https://www.thetrace.org/2017/07/nra-tv-advertising-gun-companies-culture-war/) included then-NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch’s infamous “Clenched Fist of Truth” ad, which [demonized](https://www.thetrace.org/2017/08/nra-violent-left-backfire/) the Women’s March, among other targets.   &gt;   &gt;**2017: Another hurricane, and more ominous warnings of social chaos from the NRA**   &gt;   &gt;After the storm hit the Texan Gulf Coast in 2017, NRATV host Grant Stinchfield [conjured](https://www.salon.com/2017/09/25/how-the-nra-exploited-hurricanes-to-promote-gun-ownership_partner/) the nightmarish consequences that would result from the next disaster: “When emergency personnel are pulled in every direction, do you have access to protection? … The thugs and thieves know that your vulnerability can be exploited.”   &gt;   &gt;Later, the NRA backed a Texas law, [enacted](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/06/18/nra-celebrates-highly-successful-year-in-texas-as-new-gun-bills-signed-into-law/) in 2019, that allows residents to carry open or concealed handguns without a permit for a full week after a natural disaster is declared.

The system was designed for a more agrarian economy, where things were more balanced. It also lived in a time where people were much less interconnected. Georgia might as well have been a different country than Delaware. Travel time across the country measured in weeks or months, now it takes hours. A large percentage of people used to live and die within 20 miles of where they were born, now people move from state to state and see their voting power move up or down simply because they decided to take a different job in a different city. That makes no sense.    Not to mention that the lines themselves are pretty arbitrary, and its not like all states are equal in landmass if you wanted to try to apply things by geographical area. Hell, California could be 5-6 states if one wanted to draw it that way. Areas are generally based around cities now, not geographical landmarks as much, if one were to re-map today they'd probably make new districts [centered on cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/a-new-map-for-america.html) and their surrounding rural areas.   At some level, a democracy hinges on the belief that the will of the people is being followed to maintain legitimacy. If we get to the point where a vast majority of the population keeps repeatedly getting overruled by a minority, the country is doomed to failure.   If it were me and i had total power over the process, i'd start looking at how we could make senate districts instead of just looking at state lines. Or keep the states but balance for population like we do with the house. The senate's main benefit is that it rotates its members more slowly, thus being a more slow-moving body, less prone to drastic changes on the heels of a single election.

I’d asked if he could get me a pair of tickets to a Rolling Stones concert. He couldn’t.) I kept to myself for the most part, but whenever I had a question, Ernie East, one of Donald’s vice presidents and a very nice man, helped me out. He suggested documents that might be useful, and on occasion he’d put some file folders on my desk that he thought might help. The problem was that I didn’t really know what the book was supposed to be about beyond its broad theme, which I cleverly deduced from its working title, _The Art of the Comeback_.

Ben Tulchin, a Sanders pollster, claimed the candidate was “on the brink of winning until the most unprecedented event in the history of presidential primaries occurred.”   &gt;   &gt;It is hardly unprecedented for the fifth- and sixth-place candidates to drop out of a race after four primaries. **Yet Sanders himself has fixated on this decision as evidence of an Establishment conspiracy.

Concentration Camps did not begin with the Nazis. And just because these camps fall short of Nazi concentration camps, doesn't mean they aren't still concentration camps.  Concentration camps originated under the Spanish in Cuba, in 1895, as ""reconcentrados"" camps (sound familiar?). They were in themselves inspired by how the US broke the Native American peoples. They were fortified villages. Fortified to keep people IN. The intention was to cut guerrilla fighters off from the local population who they would otherwise blend into.  They were neither designed OR intended for systematic extermination of people. They were designed to *concentrate* a large number of people into an area, for the purposes of controlling a population.  Since there were too many people, in too small an area, disease broke out.  Since there were no food supplies because the Spanish were too busy putting down a rebellion to give a shit about the civilians, and they thought the civilians could just, farm inside the fortified area, people went underfed. Most deaths in camps were due to a combination of poor nutrition combined with bad hygiene, leading to disease, compounded by a lack of medical care.  However, the tactic worked so well that it was used by: The British, the French, the Spanish (again), the Russians, the Belgians ... amongst others... all BEFORE being used by the Nazis, who took things to the next level. The pattern of, poor nutrition, bad hygiene, lack of medical care, disease outbreaks leading to death, repeats itself through this history.

In all the key criteria of Concentration Camps, these 'detention' camps fit the bill. People can call them detention camps if it makes them feel better but that is all they are doing: just making themselves feel better.  It's true that we're not at mass deaths. Yet. But if anyone believes that we can only call these concentration camps when a certain death threshold has been crossed then there is something seriously wrong with that person. That attitude is essentially ""you have to wait for the bad, preventable thing to unfold, before you can label it as a bad thing"". Death is a consequence of Concentration camps. Not an attribute of them.  As things stand, we're already in a state where we've got masses of people in unhygienic conditions, underfed, crammed into too small a space, without medical care, ...and we're forcing them to drink out of toilets. How long in these conditions do you think before there's a Typhoid or Dysentery epidemic that sweeps through the camps? These are diseases spread via infected faeces usually via food or drinking water....  That is EXACTLY the kind of thing that historically has killed the most people in camps. Not deliberate, systemic extermination, but bad conditions leading to disease. We can already see the bad conditions. Maybe it's time to stop it before the other half the equation plays itself out."

There's no definitive proof but basically the success of QAnon becoming so widespread can be attributed to a handful of people who decided to spread the good word beyond the arguably more fringe parts of the internet, 4chan and 8chan, by also bringing Twitter, YouTube and reddit into the mix.   One of them was doing a livestream where he accidentally flashed a screen of 8chan with the Q tripcode credentials* displayed and then thet quickly cut the feed  *for the completely uninitiated: 4chan and 8chan don't work with accounts, there's nothing to login to, everyone automatically posts under the name Anonymous. You can add a username when writing a post or reply but there's nothing stopping anyone from using the same handle. The only way to differentiate yourself from the other anons is by using what's called a tripcode that sorta serves as a password. It will add a unique string of letters and numbers to your username that other's can't replicate.

I understand your point that some people don’t know how to do basic research, but how are those same people going to take my word for it if they don’t trust official sources like the CDC?  [The same CDC that said about two weeks ago vaccinated individuals don't actually transmit the disease](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/vaccinated-individuals-dont-carry-virus-or-get-sick-cdc/2506677/), but then by the end of the week [had a completely different statement and walked back their previous submission?](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-walensky.html) Yes, the average layperson will see that, and wonder what the fuck is going on and who to believe. Or what about 6 ft of social distancing, but only 3 ft is required in schools? And you wonder why people are having a hard time following the CDC? Or how about Fauci and the Surgeon General with masks last March vs. that summer later? Many of our official sources have burned credibility bridges with some, so you'll need a lot more than just a stupid CDC graphic to convince people. That's the reality of it.   &gt; You’re making up a fictitious person who gets their news from Facebook and Newsmax but who would also be convinced by me talking to them for a couple of minutes. You can’t be that naïve.  When did I ever say 'talking to them in a couple minutes'? Point me to that part of any of my comments, or did you just make it up? Yes, it takes work. And we are being told a certain percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated for us to reach herd immunity and 'be safe'. So if that's work you just are not capable of, understandably don't have the patience for, or don't want to do, leave it to others with more patience and compassion.  &gt; Also, can you please admit that you were making a straw man when you alleged that everyone on here wants people to accept medicine dogmatically?  Where exactly is the strawman? There are people **in this comment section** cracking jokes about leaving these people to die, wanting to forcibly inject them, or calling them plague rats for hesitancy. Some people **are** expecting others to dogmatically accept these vaccinations, which only drives the more skeptical further away. If you want a certain percentage vaccinated by the end of the year, and **especially their children in the future** which people are **even more skeptical about**, then maybe get with the program and learn to compassionately talk to these people who need more guidance than just some internet nerd saying 'whatever, just Google it yourself, but if you fuck up, we're gonna make your life miserable and call you a plague rat'.   &gt; I've never seen anyone claim that understanding how the vaccines work, their efficacy, and the potential drawbacks is a bad thing. It’s literally the opposite - all of the pro-science comments I see encourage learning more about the vaccine.  Again. This **very thread** has examples of leaving people to die, calling them plague rats, there are media figures calling people selfish for not getting vaccinated, people being threatened with their names and addresses being passed around if they aren't vaccinated in countries like Spain (Galicia) and in Israel. If that is 'encouragement' to you, you should not be in the business of medical education and outreach.  &gt; Again, you’re just making up an argument that no one is making. It’s unfortunate that you’re getting angry at made-up arguments. Maybe take some time for self-reflection away from the internet.  This classic 'science bro' smug Reddit attitude will just continue to set back any efforts by people with the time and patience to encourage people to get vaccinated, so again, if you don't have the time, maybe leave it to people who do and completely abandon the topic of vaccine hesitancy on your own time."

It's not surprising that they would both be popular. Senators from purple states with deep rural/urban divides score much lower.

I suspect it's more accurate to think of large political trends as ""emergent"" more than strategic. For example the shift toward a hate driven GOP was probably a reaction to a black president running on ""hope"" as much as it was a tactic from some think tank. For the moment though they really have succeeded in depressing the opposition votes. It almost, and might still, backfired though. The overreach by Trump into active solicitation of foreign governments and the impeachment etc might change the conversation? I dunno, hope didn't go far and is in short supply.

Don Jr, that dude wanted this win. He looks like he's about to cry. He doesn't know anything, he's a true believer in his father.   Eric doesn't face the camera, I think that's his wife he's appealing too in this photo. But he's smiling like his brother [here](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/donald-trump-watching-election-returns.jpg), so I presume he was probably thrilled. Trump seems to treat both Beavis and Butthead similarly.   Melania isn't in that first photo, probably wasn't going to wait around all night with that idiot squad of a campaign, especially since only like a week or two earlier she heard Trump on tape bragging about molesting any woman he pleases. In the [group photo](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/donald-trump-watching-election-returns.jpg) you can see how miserable she looks. She must feel like she just dropped the handcuff key into a storm drain while she's handcuffed to a burning vehicle.   Pence, he's all red faced, you can tell he's emotional because winning VP is no joke but he's also become involved with Trump for a minimum of four years, and any future in politics he knows will be spent in Trump's shadow. Rumor has it that his wife said something like, ""Well, you for your wish"" because she didn't like Trump. How could you blame her?   You can only see his head in the bottle right corner, but one of the few people actually looking to Trump for his reaction, is Chris Christie.

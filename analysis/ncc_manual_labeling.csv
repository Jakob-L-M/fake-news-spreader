[Even in its latest guidance, the W.H.O. made its reluctance abundantly clear, saying the usefulness of face masks is “not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence,” but that governments should encourage mask wearing because of “a growing compendium of observational evidence.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/health/coronavirus-masks-who.html)  1. ""Potential reduced exposure from infected persons who are presymptomatic/asymptomatic"" - Potential doesn't sound very scientific, and considering the WHO has admitted masks are “not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence"", this benefit is a best guess.  2. ""Reduced stigmatization of individuals wearing masks"" - So if there is no science to back up the wearing of masks for general population, a benefit to wearing a mask is that we are de-stigmatizing mask use?  This isn't science, nor is it a benefit. Has anyone considered that stigmatizing, or worthy of disgrace or great disapproval, of mask use does not exist, for starters. However, wearing a mass prior to a few months ago would be considered an odd thing in the vast majority of places. The idea that a benefit of mask use is the normalizing of mask use is ridiculous.  This is not science.  As the normalizing of mask use is pushed on us, despited the admitted lack of scientific evidence, a bare unmasked face is becoming stigmatized.  People gasp in horror at the sight of a person's face in public.    3. ""Individual sense of contribution to stopping virus spread"" - This doesn't appear to be science.  Doing something for the sake of doing it despite the lack of evidence again makes no sense.  ""I do this because I think I am helping"" is nothing but spinning your tires.  Again, not science nor is there benefit beyond tricking your brain into thinking you are helping.  4. ""Reminder to individuals to be compliant with other measures (e.g. hand hygiene)"" - The benefit to wear a mask is to remind people to wash their hands?   Basic, effective public health policies such as washing your hands are based in science and data.  Wearing a mask to remind a person to do these things certainly is not.  5. ""Potential social and economic benefits (individual enterprise and community integration by creation of fabric masks)"" - I have an idea, during this economic ruining pandemic, let's just create a marketplace to create masks to save the economy.  It will sort of be like a beanie baby thing, but with masks.  It will bring people together.""  I'm not seeing the science behind this nor a benefit."

We write this  today because we feel too many people who in better times carry these  political and philosophical banners are setting aside their core beliefs  – or worse – twisting and contorting those beliefs in wholly  disappointing ways, conforming to the mandates of technocrats and  politicians, and are convincing themselves that doing so is some grand  act of solidarity with the most vulnerable people in our societies.  We say loudly that if the political tenets you promote and encourage  in the best of times whither and shrink in times of crisis, then your  political tenets are worthless. Any system of organization or any belief  about human autonomy that needs to be set aside when history lays a  challenge at our feet, is not worth keeping around when the emergency  subsides. For truly, it is times of difficulty and challenge that place  our ideas on the scale of utility to tell us whether or not they are as  robust as we may believe.  As anarchists, autonomy over one’s own mind and body are essential to  our values. We believe that human beings are intelligent enough to  decide for themselves how to assess their surroundings and to make  determinations on how to go forth living in a way that meets their needs  and desires. Of course, we recognize that this autonomy comes packaged  with genuine responsibility not only to one’s self, but to those with  whom they are in community – including the non-human world. We certainly  recognize that individuals may be asked for their cooperation in  achieving a collective goal. But we also recognize the fundamental  importance of consent in such situations, and that force and punishment  are antithetical to an anarchist worldview.  That is why we write today. To reach out to our friends, our  comrades, our intellectual and philosophical allies to ask that if you  haven’t yet, that you please begin to seriously critique and question  the state responses to the Covid19 pandemic that we are witnessing  around the world. We have watched over the proceeding year, meekly,  quietly, as other anarchists have toed the lines drawn by state  bureaucrats. We have remained silent when witnessing anarchists act with  hostility towards those who have pushed back against state mandated  curfews and lockdown orders, only because those doing the most pushing  are affiliated with right wing politics, unfortunately ceding this  ground to the right wing, instead of forging their own critiques of  state policy and thus providing an intellectual home for those who have  in isolation grown antagonistic towards those in power who are trifling  with our lives.  The impetus for this behavior amongst anarchists seems to be rooted  in their desire to do well by those in need, and as this particular  crisis is being caused by a virus, that seems to unfold as an  enthusiastic willingness to accept state mandates and to shame those who  would violate them. It is admirable to want to do well by the elderly  and infirm, but that instinct is where the conversation should begin,  not where we should resolve to set aside our fundamental principles and  to justify this by taking technocrats and politicians at their words,  using the pronouncements of sanctioned experts as a gospel by which to  claim our lack of resistance to mandate is because the mandate makes  such good sense.  Politicians lie. They select the analysis and the technicians who  promote their agendas. Corporate executives line up to support them,  knowing that the public purse is open to them when they do so. And the  media, always wanting to be in the good graces of those with political  and financial power, manufacture consent in twenty-four hour news  cycles. We know this. We have libraries full of books that we have read  and recommended explaining in detail the workings of this reality.  Therefore, to be critical of politicians who declare that their  emergency violations of basic freedoms are warranted by crisis is always  a necessity. To be critical of pharmaceutical executives who tell the  public that only they hold the keys to a future of freedom and safety,  and of the media who act as propaganda machines in service of official  narratives, is always a necessity.  Anarchists seem to know all of this instinctively when the war  politicians want us to wage is a war fought with literal weapons, when  the victims are more obvious, when the propaganda is more nationalist,  xenophobic, and racist. But with the Covid19 crisis, the war being waged  by those in power is ostensibly a war to save lives, and this shift in  presentation seems to have effectively hacked the hearts and minds of so  many anarchists who at the bottom of everything, carry a deep and  genuine care for others.  But we must pull back and think critically about our situation. It is  forgivable when in the throes of a quickly unfolding emergency, while  lacking the information necessary to make confident decisions, to want  to go along with the experts that are put before podiums when they ask  that we all pull together for the greater good. That is no longer the  situation. Much time has passed since SARS-COV-2 was a mysterious new  respiratory virus infecting tens of people in Wuhan, to being a virus  with global reach that has infected probably 20% of the human  population\*. Data has been pouring forth from researchers around the  world, and there is now no excuse for fear based decision making, for  accepting as gospel the perceptions and prescriptions stamped by the  state and distributed by their lackeys in the media.  We believe that this crisis is like all the crises that came before  it, in that it is a period of time in which those with power and wealth  see an opportunity to extend their claws and to steal more of both. It  is a moment of collective fear and uncertainty they can exploit to seize  more control and to enrich themselves at the expense of the masses of  humanity. The only thing that seems to separate the Covid19 crisis from  those that came before it, is just how willing so much of the public  (sadly including many anarchists) is to willingly and enthusiastically  support the loss of their own autonomy.  \*In early October The WHO reported an estimate that 10% of the global  population had had Covid19. It is therefore reasonable that after a  second winter in the Northern Hemisphere, that that number could have  doubled.  **The Science!!!**  Right out of the gate we think it is very important to underscore the  dangerous, quasi religious nature of how the media and state are  pushing, and how the public is accepting, the notion of a unified  scientific consensus on how to politically approach the question of  Covid19. First and foremost, science is a method, a tool, and it’s  foundational premise is that we must always ask questions, and we must  always try to falsify our hypothesis. Science is absolutely NOT about  consensus, as the right experiment conducted by one person can  absolutely demolish established dogmas with new information, and that is  science at its most glorious. Further, SARS-COV-2 is a virus that has  been known to humanity at large for now just over one year. To suggest  that there is a total and irrefutable understanding of it’s features and  dynamics, and that all scientists and researchers and doctors  everywhere are all in agreement as to what public policy should be to  confront it, is absolutely false.  Also, we enter into very dangerous territory as a society when we  allow, nay demand, that experts tucked away in labs using esoteric  methods act as the only voices in the room to generate one-size-fits-all  policy declarations for entire nations that span massive geographical  terrain, for nations populated with vastly diverse groups of human  beings who all have different needs. This kind of technocracy is a great  cause for concern, as are any pronouncements that those who are  skeptical of such schemes of social manipulation are somehow  intellectual dullards or that that are anti-scientific.  Science is a tool to illuminate humanity through the elucidation of  cause and effect mechanisms. It is a process of discovery. What we do  with that illumination, how we go about our lives with the information  discovered, is up to us as individuals and as communities.  And finally, it is very easy to fall into a trap of finding competing  experts. One side has an expert who says X and the other side finds an  expert who says Y, and then we’re at an impasse. This is not our intent,  however, we feel we are in a double-bind if we do not at some level  demonstrate that the narrative out forth by the state and their lap dog  media is not as rooted in scientific fact as they would like us to  believe. If we do not present some amount of counter evidence, we risk  being dismissed out of hand as ignorant, individualists, whose true  motivations are “selfish.” Cracking through a billion dollar narrative  that has been crafted by state and private media around the globe for  the better part of a year, all in service of generating an atmosphere of  fear and thus compliance, is no easy task, and so, we will now point to  some research below in an effort to help our readers build a  reality-based, data-backed understanding of the current situation, not  to position ourselves as possessing some secret alternative knowledge,  but merely to demonstrate that there does exist research that makes many  state mandates seem preposterous even from a scientific perspective.  **Research**  The underlying premise behind lockdowns, closures, and curfews is  that these efforts can stop the spread of SARS-COV-2. But can they  accomplish this? This is a nuanced question. First, we would acknowledge  that if you could isolate every human in their own bubble, yes, you  could burn out probably many diseases (while causing a variety of new  harms). But that isn’t how a mandate functions in reality. Even  excluding the shadowy scofflaws who are blamed for the failures of these  lockdown efforts from California to London because of their failure to  comply with perfection, the fact is that modern civilization requires a  massive amount of daily labor in order to prevent it’s immediate  collapse, and that labor requires human beings to come into contact with  each other, and to travel great distances.  Everything from farm work, to long haul trucking. Power plant  operation to plumbers making house calls. Doctors must go to hospital,  as must the janitorial and kitchen staff. Fertilizer factories must keep  producing for the following season, and so too must the sprawling data  centers remain operational for all the white collar professionals to be  able to meet via Zoom. Then there are the Amazon warehouses and  Wal-Marts! How could we lockdown without our daily deliveries? The list  of industries and institutions that cannot close if we expect to have  heated homes, drinkable water, functional electric grids, drivable  roads, and every other support system of modern life, is very long, and  each of them requires human beings to keep them functional. This fact  alone means there could never be a 100% lockdown of the population.  Of course, there is the obvious side note that a majority of the  labor that must continue, is low wage and/or blue collar. This fact  alone makes the very idea of lockdowns a classist enterprise, but this  fact has been discussed widely, so we shall move on.  Remember too, these massive lockdowns were never intended (in most  places, at the outset) to eliminate Covid19. They were intended to  “flatten the curve,” which translates to, “slow the spread” of  SARS-COV-2 so that hospitals would not be overwhelmed. It should be  noted that most hospitals in most locales, never faced this threat, and  that even if it is a good idea to prevent hospital overrun, plans to  prevent such a scenario would need to be local, not national, or even  statewide. As the year progressed, slowly, the perception of the intent  of lockdowns has blurred, and politicians and their selected experts  have been consistently extending shutdowns, now shifting the rhetoric to  focus on the eradication of the virus. This is unacceptable in that it  is likely impossible.  As to these lockdown measures and their efficacy, [research has found](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eci.13484) that they do not have much of an effect when it comes to reducing total caseload:  &gt;“Conclusions: While small benefits  cannot be excluded, we do not find significant benefits on case growth  of more restrictive NPIs. Similar reductions in case growth may be  achievable with less restrictive interventions.”  [Another paper concludes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full):  &gt;“Higher Covid death rates are  observed in the \[25/65°\] latitude and in the \[−35/−125°\] longitude  ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life  expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and  non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases  prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and  environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the  measures settled to fight pandemic, including lockdown, did not appear  to be linked with death rate.”  We must absolutely understand that no intervention comes without its  costs, and when an intervention involves distance, isolation, and the  shut down of people’s usual outlets for social interaction and support,  those costs are borne by the physical, mental, and emotional health of  the public. We cannot destroy public health to save public health. [This editorial from the British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4074) states:  &gt;“Lockdowns can also cause long  term health harms, such as from delayed treatment and investigations.  Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of various types of cancer, for  example, can allow progression of cancer and affect patients’ survival. A  three month delay to surgery is estimated to cause more than 4700  deaths a year in the UK. In the US, delays in screening and treatment  are estimated to cause 250,000 additional preventable deaths of cancer  patients each year.   Furthermore, a sharp decrease in the number of  admissions for acute coronary syndromes and emergency coronary  procedures has been observed since the start of the pandemic in the US  and Europe. In England, the weekly number of hospital admissions for  coronary syndromes fell by 40% between mid-February and the end of March  2020. Fear of exposure to the virus stopped many patients from  attending hospital, putting them at increased risk of long term  complications of myocardial infarction.”  Despite the push by the people in power to present their preferred  draconian measures as totally supported by “the science,” there is much  disagreement amongst researchers and doctors as to how best to move  through this crisis. [Scientific American writes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-covid-science-wars1/):  &gt;“In today’s COVID-19 wars, the  global scientific divide leans heavily in favor of active, and sometimes  even draconian, public health interventions, including widespread  locking down of nonessential business, mandating masks, restricting  travel and imposing quarantines. On the other side, some doctors,  scientists and public health officials are questioning the wisdom of  this approach in the face of massive unknowns about their efficacy and  in light of the clear and growing evidence that such measures may not be  working in some cases, and may also be causing net harm. As people are  thrown out of work as a direct result of lockdowns, and as more and more  families find themselves unable to cover their rent or food, there have  been sharp increases in domestic violence, homelessness and illegal  drug use.”  When justifying harsh lockdowns and curfews, many people lean into  the danger presented by Covid19, without fully understanding the actual  level of threat posed by the illness. Due to the alarmist posture of the  media – an industry we know bases their success on capturing attention,  and which also goes to great pains to push official political  narratives – many people believe that an infection with SARS-COV-2 is  far more deadly than it actually is. According to a study authored by  Stanford’s John P. Ioannidis, the Infection Fatality Rate globally is  quite low:  &gt;“Infection fatality rate in  different locations can be inferred from seroprevalence studies. While  these studies have caveats, they show IFR ranging from 0.00% to 1.54%  across 82 study estimates. Median IFR across 51 locations is 0.23% for  the overall population and 0.05% for people &lt;70 years old. IFR is  larger in locations with higher overall fatalities. Given that these 82  studies are predominantly from hard‐hit epicenters, IFR on a global  level may be modestly lower. Average values of 0.15%‐0.20% for the whole  global population and 0.03%‐0.04% for people &lt;70 years old as of  October 2020 are plausible. These values agree also with the WHO  estimate of 10% global infection rate (hence, IFR \~ 0.15%) as of early  October 2020.”  We also are aware of a common sentiment that lockdowns could  eliminate SARS-COV-2 if only they were stricter, and if only every  person participated perfectly. This is the sort of unfalsifiable  thinking that politicians and pundits like to push to excuse the failure  of previous measures to have the desired outcomes, as well as to target  their opposing politicians who they like to insist “dropped the ball,”  and who should therefore bear the blame for the pandemic’s toll. Any  policy that requires 100% compliance is doomed to fail from the outset.  Even ignoring our earlier point about the labor required to maintain  society, there will never be 100% compliance from all human beings on  anything.  We think it is also necessary to make plain that a new coronavirus is  not something that would be detected immediately by doctors or  researchers when it makes its first jump from animal to human. Because  coronaviruses are common, and because they induce similar symptoms (as  well as having a symptom course similar to other forms of respiratory  viruses), and as SARS-COV-2 is not symptomatic in a third of people who  contract it, it is not surprising that it was circulating the Earth  before anyone knew to look for it.  [It has now been confirmed that SARS-COV-2 was circulating in Italy in September of 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0300891620974755):  &gt;“SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific  antibodies were detected in 111 of 959 (11.6%) individuals, starting  from September 2019 (14%), with a cluster of positive cases (&gt;30%) in  the second week of February 2020 and the highest number (53.2%) in  Lombardy. This study shows an unexpected very early circulation of  SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in Italy several months before  the first patient was identified, and clarifies the onset and spread of  the coronavirus disease 2019”  [It was circulating in the UK in December:](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-daughter-of-first-uk-victim-questions-when-coronavirus-arrived-in-the-country-12203040)  &gt;“Professor Tim Spector,  epidemiologist at King’s College London, leads the Zoe Covid Symptom  Study, tracking symptoms reported by patients during the pandemic.   He said data collected “clearly shows many people had the virus back in December”.  [It was also circulating in the US back in late fall of 2019:](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1785/6012472)  &gt;“These confirmed reactive sera  included 39/1,912 (2.0%) donations collected between December 13-16,  2019, from residents of California (23/1,912) and Oregon or Washington  (16/1,912). Sixty seven confirmed reactive (67/5,477, 1.2%) donations  were collected between December 30, 2019, and January 17, 2020, from  residents of Massachusetts (18/5,477), Wisconsin or Iowa (22/5,477),  Michigan (5/5,477), and Connecticut or Rhode Island (33/5,477).”  Other examples exist demonstrating that SARS-COV-2 was circulating in  various countries around the world prior to confirmation of its  existence coming out of China. As time unfolds, it is likely we will get  a fuller picture of what this circulation looked like, but we can  safely presume that if there are antibodies within people on various  continents in December of 2019, that circulation of the virus would have  begun months prior to that. And we point this fact out, again, to  emphasize that there was likely no lockdown measure that could have been  implemented to snuff out the virus, as it had already gotten such an  incredible head start.  **On Principle**  As anarchists, there are principles we return to as guiding stars in  the dark night of the unknown, and these include freedom, autonomy,  consent, and a deep belief in the ability of people to self-organize for  their maximum benefit as individuals and as communities. No one knows  one’s needs better than they do themselves, and truly, most people have  self-preservation instincts that cause them to select behaviors that  lead to their own safety and survival, as well as that of those they  care for.  At the outset of the pandemic, when information was scant, we very  much witnessed people making choices to distance themselves from crowds  and gatherings they did not believe were essential, while they also  began efforts to support and care for those who might be more vulnerable  to a circulating respiratory illness that did not have well established  treatment courses within the medical field.  While we welcome information and data, even that which is unpleasant,  that describes the continually unfolding circumstances, we also believe  that people need to be trusted to analyze that information. The current  paradigm has the state and their selected technocratic experts  filtering the available data and only highlighting that which supports  the policy decisions they already decided to implement without any  public input. Information and analysis that can be considered “good  news” has been largely ignored by the state and their technocrats, while  also being blacked out by the media.  “Experts” can always be found to justify horrors. Indeed, we would  likely be hard pressed to find a case in recent history in which massive  crimes against humanity did not come packaged with a stamp of approval  from some consortium of experts whom everyone else was asked to blindly  trust. The Covid19 pandemic is no different, and as anarchists we just  ask that you remember that debate, critique, and dissent are all  essential components of societies that value liberation and autonomy. We  ask that whatever you decide about the efficacy of lockdown measures,  that you recognize no situation, no matter how dire it may seem,  warrants edicts from on high that use the threat of force and violence  to accomplish their aims.  Our steadfast commitment to human autonomy, and to our belief that no  authority is valid without the consent of those it is exercised over,  is what makes anarchism a thing apart from other political philosophies.  We will not abandon this commitment, and hope that you will not either."

His only tactic is to delegitimize the opposition in the eyes of his supporters, thus having an able and willing army to back him when and if he is defeated at the ballot box.   Trump won't leave office after losing in a landslide, will claim voter fraud and rile up his base to commit violence before and after the election. It wouldn't surprise me if 1 million of Trump's brownshirts (like those who post on T\_D) with guns will be on the streets committing violence left and right and repeatedly clash with law enforcement and the military in a futile attempt to install Trump as a dictator.

The answer is the lawyer Harriet Wistrich and the journalist Julie Bindel. Magson is by no means the first woman to have stabbed a man through the heart they have championed. In February 1985, teenage prostitute Emma Humphreys murdered her lover Trevor Armitage as he lay in a drunken stupor. Her murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter in June 1995, and she walked free time served. She was dead from a (possibly accidental) drug overdose three years later. Incredibly, Bindel and Wistrich started an annual award in her honour.    &gt;In November 2014, Kyle Farrell was murdered by Farieissia Martin in strikingly similar fashion to Magson’s murder of James Knight. She too has won an appeal and a retrial thanks to Harriet Wistrich   &gt;Her technique is simple. Under English law, an accused is entitled to only one trial. After conviction, fresh evidence will not be permitted for an appeal. The reason for this is or should be obvious. Given enough time and resources, evidence can be manufactured to prove a guilty defendant innocent, or at least to cast a reasonable doubt on said conviction. For example, false witnesses can be procured by bribery or some other artifice. There is though an exception to the fresh evidence rule. According to the Criminal Appeal Act, 1995, fresh evidence will be admitted if there is “a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence” at trail,  and if the fresh evidence is considered by the Court Of Appeal to be “capable of belief”.    &gt;With the Emma Humphreys case and the aforementioned Sally Challen case, this so-called fresh evidence consisted of claims about the mental condition of the accused, and slanders on the victim. Although he had a violent past, Trevor Armitage wasn’t credibly accused of assaulting Humphreys at the time, on the contrary, she had trashed his home then found herself remanded in custody after breaking her bail conditions by assaulting a hotel manager and a police officer while soliciting. Indeed, when she appeared in court, she was discharged into his custody. It was only after she wrote to Wistrich and Bindel that allegations of violence were  raised.   &gt;Similarly, at her trial, Sally Challen said nothing about the abuse she had allegedly suffered at the hands of her estranged husband, neither did her two sons. In her first appeal, which was against sentence only, the Court Of Appeal found she had been “eaten up with jealousy at her husband’s friendships with other women, and had decided that if she could not have him then no one would”.   &gt;She had monitored his Facebook page, hacked his e-mails, and asked a neighbour to spy on him, yet come her second appeal, he was portrayed as the coercive controller and she as the innocent victim.    &gt;In sentencing Emma-Jayne Magson, Judge Baker said he would liked to have increased her tariff, but was constrained by the law from doing so. He might have added this case should never have been heard a second time, and neither should those of any of the other killers championed by Harriet Wistrich and her so-called charity."

Yet too often in our nation’s history they’ve been about tribalism along regional, economic and, most divisively, racial lines.  Then came 2020: This Election Day, President Trump garnered the highest percentage of non-white votes for a Republican presidential candidate in 60 years. This movement toward balance should be celebrated by all, but not surprisingly, that is not what is happening.  Take MSNBC anchor Joy Reid, who claims that the election showed a “great amount of racism, anti-blackness and anti-wokeness.” Or The New York Times’ Charles Blow, who somehow sees this election as confirming the power of the “White Patriarchy.”  Writer Bree Newsome Bass conceded that some white voters had chosen Joe Biden but voted Republican down ballot to preserve “white rule.”  These people view everything through a racial lens. They’re convinced Trump is a racist and regard his broad support — half the country voted for him — as proof that the nation, as a whole, is likewise hopelessly racist.  A kind way to describe such reactions would be “unhinged.” Another way: terrified.  Between 2004 and 2016, black men and women gave between 88 percent and 95 percent of their votes to the Democratic candidate for president. This year, Trump won 18 percent of the vote among black men — a staggering number for a Republican.  To put that in visceral terms, of every six black men who voted, one voted for Trump.  He also made significant gains with Hispanic voters and even Muslim voters.  https://nypost.com/2020/11/06/trump-won-record-minority-support-yet-the-left-is-calling-it-racism/   https://cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/trump-wins-highest-share-minority-vote-any-republican-candidate-1960

On one had he’s saying it’s AGW causing it and all the weather is abnormal.    Then he says it’s lightening, but then argues the size of the fire because his own source contradicts what he’s claiming.    He then cherry picks different regions to fit his narrative, which is what he accused Tony Heller of doing.    Then he does on to argue from authority using the very people who failed to do their jobs in regards to hazard reduction burning and shouts “expert” he entire time.  He dismisses the fact that land owners are having trouble getting permission to do their own prescribed burns, and glosses over the environmentalist factor that has played a role in this problem.  https://www.smh.com.au/national/prescribed-burning-what-is-it-and-will-more-reduce-bushfire-risks-20200106-p53paf.html   https://www.trfm.com.au/articles/planned-burns-halted/  So according to Potholer no news outlet should be trusted, and we should take the work of government officials who have failed to do their jobs and who are covering their asses.  I’m guessing he’s also lumping in the BBC whom he used to work for as well.    https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50400851  He cherry picks what he wants to present and dismisses any opinion or information that runs counter to his ideology.  He can claim AGW is influencing these fires all day long, but he will still be wrong.  There is zero empirical evidence that AWG even exists, let alone has anything to do with the fires whatsoever.    I look into everything before I say anything or repost,  Potholer is a cherry picking liar, and a Sophist that hides behind “peer review” like its some bastion of truth and accuracy.    His new shtick is to call everyone who disagrees with his ideology a conspiracy theorist.  It’s pretty pathetic.

The fact is, asymptomatics simply don't have enough viral load to spread viruses as efficiently as symptomatics. Respiratory viruses can travel over 20 feet when someone coughs or sneezes. Simply having no symptoms and breathing within a couple of feet of someome is highly unlikely to transmit the virus.  And about masks. The fact that covid just kept spreading (surging) after months of mask mandates should be glaring proof enough that masks either do nothing or not a significant difference.

Evil is that for which they have bartered away their souls. To deny God’s own revelation, grudging that He should reveal His bounty to whom He chooses from among His servants! They have incurred God’s most inexorable wrath. An ignominious punishment awaits the unbelievers.” Quran 2:89-2:90   “I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads, strike off the very tips of their fingers.” Quran 8:12   “Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them.

They are friends with one another…” Quran 5:51  What Muhammad had to say about infidels according to the hadith    Narrated Ikrima: Ali burnt some people and this news reached Ibn 'Abbas, who said, ""Had I been in his place I would not have burnt them, as the Prophet said, 'Don't punish (anybody) with Allah's Punishment.' No doubt, I would have killed them, for the Prophet said, **'If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.**' ""- [Sahih Bukhari 4:52:260](https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-4/Book-52/Hadith-260/)   Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""The Jews will fight with you, and you will be given victory over them so that a stone will say, '**O Muslim!

Jesus dying on the cross for filled all of those sacrifices, that’s why we no longer have to sacrifice lambs and state codes and things. That’s actual biblical history, and the entire point of Jesus dying on the cross. We no longer have to do ritual cleansing, like Women having to sleep in a tent while we were on our periods, because there is no such thing as ritualistically unclean anymore, because Jesus covered it with his blood. There is a lot of information about that in the book of Matthew, including Jesus’ own words.  All of those old laws were a poor substitute for the sacrifice of God‘s only son on the cross. Here are some links so you can read more about it if you’re actually interested. (This is also why non-Jewish Christians or Gentiles don’t have to adhere to things like kosher, and Jewish people do; they do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah and the son of God, so therefore they are still adhering to the old laws, and why if you look at like Hasidic Jews, they still wear their hair long and we are very traditional robes, because they believe that they are still beholden to the tenants of the old testament.)  https://www.gotquestions.org/abolish-fulfill-law.html  https://www.simplycatholic.com/bible-101-jesus-fulfills-the-old-testament/  https://davidschrock.com/2018/07/16/how-does-jesus-fulfill-the-law-christ-his-teaching-and-the-new-covenant/amp/  This is also why we can speak directly to God and have a direct relationship with him instead of having to go through a priest. In Jewish culture, you could only pray at a certain court in the temple and the only person who could enter the holy of holy ‘s, the innermost portion of the temple, was the high priest, and he could only do that once a year on Passover after having extraordinary ritualistic cleansing that allowed him to enter that place without being burned up. That is also why Jewish people have had a history of being snobby or discriminatory in old testament times, because they didn’t want to interact with non-Jewish people and become ritualistically and clean and not be able to make their sacrifices in the temple."

But even a quick scan of the paper reveals that this is not the case. Cook is able to demonstrate only that a relative handful endorse “the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.” Cook calls this “explicit endorsement with quantification” (quantification meaning 50 percent or more). The problem is, only a small percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what percentage, but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David Friedman, one observer calculated that **only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming.**""   ""The 97 percent claim is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to intimidate the public—and numerous scientists whose papers were classified by Cook protested:  “Cook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5/10 were rated incorrectly. 4/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.” —Dr. Richard Tol  “That is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .” —Dr. Craig Idso  “Nope . . . it is not an accurate representation.” —Dr. Nir Shaviv  “Cook et al.

Zhao used the image to accuse Australian soldiers of “murdering Afghan civilians.” He posted the tweet following a recent news [report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-defence-idUSKBN27Y32J) that some Australian special forces soldiers committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.   &gt;   &gt;The fake image was created by a Chinese graphic artist named Fu Yu, who published the image on his Weibo account on Nov. 23. Weibo is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.   &gt;   &gt;The image has since drawn outcry in Australia. Prime Minister [Scott Morrison](https://www.theepochtimes.com/australia-demands-apology-from-china-for-repugnant-tweet-by-ccp-spokesman_3597926.html) has demanded an apology from Zhao, saying it was a “terrible slur” on Australian soldiers. The Australian government is also seeking Twitter to remove the image.   &gt;   &gt;On Dec. 1, Twitter rejected Australia’s calls, but marked Zhao’s tweet as “sensitive.” The social media giant said that comments on political issues or “foreign policy saber-rattling” by official government accounts usually do not violate its rules, according to an [AFP report](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2020/12/02/2003747969).   &gt;   &gt;On Tuesday, Rubio sent a [letter](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f10473d8-7388-41e3-82e4-716855928342/BFD85DB999A49B86E130A8709EE8098C.20.12.01--rubio-letter-to-twitter-on-zhao-lijian-tweet.pdf) to [Jack Dorsey](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-jack-dorsey), Twitter’s chief executive officer, questioning the platform’s decision.   &gt;   &gt;“\[I\]t appears Twitter made an intentional decision not to remove the tweet or even issue a warning label. We know your company has the ability to move rapidly, as it frequently issued warning labels on tweets of prominent Americans during the election—sometimes within minutes of a tweet being sent,” Rubio wrote.   &gt;   &gt;Rubio then asked Dorsey to answer several questions: “Did Twitter conduct a review of the tweet? If so, what was the nature of that review and why was no action taken as a result? If not, why was the tweet not subject to review?”   &gt;   &gt;“Do you stand by the process and the decision? If not, what steps have been taken to avoid such mistakes in the future?” Rubio asked.   &gt;   &gt;Finally, Rubio asked Dorsey to comment on whether Twitter “wants to operate in China in the future” and if so, “has it had any conversations with relevant officials or entities in China?”   &gt;   &gt;Rubio later took to his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1333889290443644928) account, comparing the social media giant’s response to the doctored image versus a tweet by President Donald Trump.   &gt;   &gt;“When Trump tweeted about sending in the national guard to protect a city against looting u/twitter blocked it for ‘violating terms,’ the senator wrote.   &gt;   &gt;He added: “But when a govt official from #China tweets a fake image that could result in violence they only label it ‘potentially sensitive content.’”"

You know exactly at that point that it’s all fake. Just put yourself in their shoes. What is the best con? One that people think is not only true, but that their actions are helping prevent it. Again it is why they are called useful idiots. Like NPCs with a string attached to their back and when you pull, all you hear is “science is settled” over and over and over again.  I’m not saying their isn’t a market for electric cars or solar panels because there is, but when you compare the two there is no comparison.   Has anyone ever looked up what is made from the oil industry? What is made from [Petroleum](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partial-list-over-6000-products-made-from-one-barrel-oil-steve-pryor/)?  Only 45% of it is gasoline that goes in cars. There are over 6000 products made from oil. Do wind turbines make anything? In fact oil is made in wind turbine gear boxes. Better get rid of your phones. That’s right. Oil is made in the production of your phone. How bout Solar panels? Is there anything else that it produces? How about the batteries for those electric cars? Looks like even [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/05/02/cnn-freedom-project-electric-cars-cobalt-elbagir-pkg.cnn) published an article about Cobalt, which is one of myriad minerals and metals that is needed to make such battery. Even CNN saw that this stuff needs to be MINED. Wait, I thought Democrats were against mining? It is also mined by children (yes children). Democrats love their slave labor. Kids young as 4 are doing this. No wonder why they want jobs sent overseas. That’s near 100% profit.   Apparently if you work around Cobalt for a long time, you can get very sick with what is called [Cobalt Lung](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-toll-of-the-cobalt-mining-industry-congo/#textAccording20to20the20CDC2C2022chronic20exposure20to20cobalt-containinga20lung20disease20caused20by20inhaling20dust20particles). My source is CBS, which is another lefty news outlet. So either CBS and CNN are right or they are fake news? Looks like you won’t be able to slither your way out of this one, Leftists.  Cobalt Lung currently has no cure. Cobalt is said to end up in products from Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and Samsung.   “Sustained exposures can cause skin sensitization, which may result in eruptions of contact dermatitis,"" a red, itchy skin rash, the CDC says. So not only do we have the lungs to worry about, but now the skin. Wow! But but but Green Energy. Yeah, by the time it reaches the USA. Remember that is just ONE resource. There are many more, not to mention unlike oil, we only have a limited amount of these. You may ask them, “Why do Leftists choose your do this? They always start something new every few years. In fact, they used to be huge supporters of [Natural Gas](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-used-to-like-natural-gas-energy-not-anymore-1469574395). I wonder why they stopped?  Anyways, here are some of the things made out of oil: pills, capsules, syringes, heating aids, pacemakers, artificial hips, prosthetic limbs, crutches, eyeglasses and wheelchairs, fertilizers, pesticides, detergents, solvents, asphalt and tar (Infrastructure), plastic, salt, tires (that’s a big one), ballpoint pen, cleats, football, life jackets, rubbing alcohol, umbrellas, hoses, electric blankets, Dentures (Joe Biden &amp; Nancy Pelosi have them), wheels, trash bags, soap, boats, credit cards, parachutes, shaving cream, etc....."

Pelosi was reacting to Trump’s signing of the $900 billion stimulus package that was tied to a larger omnibus bill. The package authorized direct payments and checks for up to $600.  “The signing of the bipartisan, bicameral coronavirus relief legislation is welcome news for the fourteen million Americans who just lost the lifeline of unemployment benefits on Christmas Weekend, and for the millions more struggling to stay afloat during this historic pandemic and economic crisis,” Pelosi [wrote in a statement](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/122720) on her website.  But Trump should “immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000,” the speaker added, remarking that the measure will be brought to the House floor on Monday.  In her statement, Pelosi seemingly attempted to put pressure on Republicans ahead of the Jan. 5 runoff election in Georgia, where two Senate seats are up for grabs.  “Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need,” she said.  Some GOP legislators have expressed concerns about how the stimulus payments would be funded.  “If we went to $2,000 per person, the additional borrowing would be up to almost $500 billion,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said, according to KUTV. “Someone’s got to pay for that. We can’t just have free money.”  Romney qualified his remarks by saying that he opposes $600 payments as well.  After Pelosi said she would call a House session $2,000 stimulus payments on Monday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that Democrats are ignoring other concerns expressed by Trump. He pointed to Trump’s video last week where he said the stimulus bill contained too many unneeded provisions such as foreign aid programs.  House Democrats “have conveniently ignored the concerns expressed by the president, and shared by our constituents, that we ought to reexamine how our tax dollars are spent overseas while so many of our neighbors at home are struggling to make ends meet,” McCarthy said in a statement last week.  “Thus, Republicans will offer a unanimous consent request to revisit the state and foreign operations title of the omnibus so that we can fully address the concerns at hand. It will be up to Speaker Pelosi to decide if she wants to act on behalf of the American people,” he remarked."""

There's dozens and hundreds of different versions of them.  Some vaccines are better than others, some more safe than others, so on and so forth.  `also completely eradicated a disease, look up Small Pox.`   &amp;#x200B;  Not completely. No. It had to do with other factors as well.  Smallpox was drastically mitigated by quarantining, sanitation, sewage systems, and hygiene. Vaccines played a part, but don't deserve all the credit, not even most, only half or so.  Also, for gods sake, don't tell me to ''look up smallpox'' I've known what smallpox is about since I was 6 years old, and I've actually read books on it. Have you read about the Leicester method, or the gloucester method? Or how Edward Jenner came up with the idea, and about his life?   Anyway, moving on.    `The deadliest disease in human history`   The deadliest? No, that was the plague.    `now it doesn't exist thanks to a worldwide push for vaccines`   Well, it does exist still, but it's kept in secure labs. It might even be used for biowarfare one day.  Can I ask, what is the main goal of vaccines? To make something like smallpox go away? Or to save lives?   I'd hope the latter, because eradicating smallpox did NOT come without COST.   It may or may not have killed half the people the disease did. Especially in it's technological infancy.  Do you agree that, the cure cannot be worse than the problem? If so, it's interesting to consider what might have happened had smallpox not occurred in 17th century, poverty ridden, dirty, crammed, pre victorian cities where 12 people slept in one tiny bedroom, no one had proper clean water, sewage systems were lacking, and people used to treat mental illness by cutting out people's brains.  Would there have been soo many lives to SAVE? Would the vaccine be a net LOSS, because the disease would have killed such fewer people?   `Your claims are unfounded and not backed by any real world evidence.`   I didn't make anymore than ONE claim. So CLAIM''s'' is not grammatically correct. I asked two questions and made ONE claim, about autoimmune diseases caused by vaccines, which is backed up by THE VACCINE INSERT SHEET THAT COMES IN THE BOX, and many studies and court cases that show vaccinations ability to cause encephalopathy.   Here: [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-to-receive-15m-plus-in-first-ever-vaccine-autism-court-award/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-to-receive-15m-plus-in-first-ever-vaccine-autism-court-award/)  [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccine-injury-case-offer/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccine-injury-case-offer/)  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18480200/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18480200/)  You can look up the vaccine inserts of any vaccine you want, you will find many immunosuppressive side effects written on most of them.

We assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols.***        &gt;   &gt;***We recovered infectious virus from 52 (39%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89%) of the NP swabs with valid cultures.

These had historically been counted separately. They’re saying that PIC cases are above the epidemic threshold.  Another theory centers on viral interference, which is the phenomenon in which a cell infected by a virus becomes resistant  to other viruses; basically, cells are rarely infected with more than one virus, so COVID-19 could be winning out over influenza."

Olga Khazan summarized the paper well in an article for the Atlantic: &gt;  &gt; The issue doesn’t appear to be girls’ aptitude for STEM professions. In looking at test scores across 67 countries and regions, Stoet and Geary found that girls performed about as well or better than boys did on science in most countries, and in almost all countries, girls would have been capable of college-level science and math classes if they had enrolled in them. &gt;  &gt; But when it comes to their relative strengths, in almost all the countries—all except Romania and Lebanon—boys’ best subject was science, and girls’ was reading. (That is, even if an average girl was as good as an average boy at science, she was still likely to be even better at reading.) Across all countries, 24 percent of girls had science as their best subject, 25 percent of girls’ strength was math, and 51 percent excelled in reading. For boys, the percentages were 38 for science, 42 for math, and 20 for reading. &gt;  &gt; The study found that gender differences increased in countries that have greater gender equality as measured by the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Gender Gap Report. They noted that countries with the highest gender equality tend to be “welfare states…with a high level of social security for all its citizens,” which they believe can influence women’s choices. They describe this as a paradox because it implies that the more progress we make towards achieving the equality agenda, the further we are likely to be from achieving the equity agenda. As Khazan says in the conclusion to her article, “it could just be that, feeling financially secure and on equal footing with men, some women will always choose to follow their passions, rather than whatever labor economists recommend. And those passions don’t always lie within science.”  By the way, these folk are making the same mistake as so many by thinking that the WEF's Gender gap index measures the gender gap. So, it can be said that the more unequal a country becomes the more women do thinks they like andd leave the boring and dangerous stuff to men.  It's telling that almost nobody sees this as aproblem. Hell, most people don't even know about it."

Just look at who makes up most of our higher education.   https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/10/11/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment#:~:text=%20%20%20Field%20of%20Study%20%20,%20%202%2C539%20%209%20more%20rows%20  These massive fields like EE and CS are 80% foreigners. I think we will kill our country if we give foreigners the top spots in our world leading universities and then kick them out instead of trying our hardest to get them to stay.  I think there are really two paths:  1. Force universities to take on more Americans so we have a better educated workforce.  Or  2. Start hiring these internationals instead of kicking them out.  We are giving our precious educational resources to these people and then getting rid of them, ridiculous imo.

Which political party has blocked every attempt at an independent ballot audit?  This could have all been avoided if the Democrats had allowed an audit and examination of voting machines. Instead, Democrats were literally saying independent audits would undermine the election. That doesn't sound like they were very confident in the results of the election.     &gt;The affidavits are complete junk.   My favorite part about many of the affidavits is they corroborate a claim made about a year earlier.. by Elizabeth Warren. See before Nov 3 it was actually the prevailing narrative that the 2016 elections were compromised and that we needed to avoid electronic voting machines.  [From Elizabeth Warren's report](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/H.I.G.%20McCarthy,%20&amp;%20Staple%20Street%20letters.pdf):  &gt;In 2018 alone ""voters in South Carolina \[were\] reporting machines that switched their votes after they'd inputted them, scanners \[were\] rejecting paper ballots in Missouri,   &gt;   &gt;And, just this year, after the Democratic candidate's electronic tally showed he received an improbable 164 votes out of 55,000 cast in a Pennsylvania state judicial election in 2019   &gt;   &gt;These problems threaten the integrity of our elections and demonstrate the importance of election systems that are strong, durable, and not vulnerable to attack.  Isn't it crazy how these findings were almost verbatim what was in the affidavits? What a wild coincidence. Also all of the affidavits were under oath, and nobody has actually challenged their validity legally speaking.     &gt; The video is real, but you are being lied to about what's happening.   Yes, by people in the media and government. The government said that they had ballot watchers in the room the whole time. The video shows nobody in that room watching. The media initially said the poll workers went home that night, then changed the story to they never went home.  Maybe you can look at plain as day security footage of one thing while being told another, but I can't do that. There are four lights."

Your basically asking a thanos question, which would never fly or happen in real life.  First off being pregnant isn't easy at all. I have a ten month old and I'm still recovering from my pregnancy and birth. Love him to death but I would NEVER wish pregnancy on another woman who didn't want it.   Your free to hold your own opinion on this but as I myself am a female and been pregnant, and gave birth to a baby I'm going to drop some info.  Pregnancy isn't 9 months, it can last longer. In my baby group, half the women went over their due date. Not just 1 or 2 days but a week over. At that point they have to be induced with medication.  Women have it hard enough without people shaming them for trying to have authority over their own bodies.  1 in 4 pregnancy's end in misscarages, yet a doctor will not look for the cause and or reason until the women has 3 or more misscarages.  Many women who do not want kids ever and wish to be sterile, are deinyed because doctors don't think a woman should deprive her future spouse a child.  Men can access condoms easily, a woman cannot access birth control without a prescription (not counting condoms)  There are risk in pregnancy, if a woman develops gestational diabetes, she has a higher risk of getting type too diabetes. And chances were she was healthy before becoming pregnant.  Preeclampsia, hypertension, and high blood pressure are a few other risk she has to deal with.  Placentia eruption is another one.  Missing work due to appointments, and or being sick.   Speaking of being sick, got a cold? Flu? A headache? Well to bad butter cup. Can't take anything for it. Lest it harm the growing fetus.   Then there is the birth, my own story, is long but I'll keep it short.  Basically I almost died, meaning my son almost died to. If I didn't have a c section my husband would be a widow. I was on bed rest for 8 weeks.   If I had a normal vag birth, it be less, but then I could have tearing, and or have a doctor give me the ""husband stitch"" making sex painful until it was fixed.  Then there are the medical cost of all this. I thank my lucky stars that I have free health care. And paid mat leave, I can have up to 18 months paid leave.   But other women who don't have what I have, can't take time off work to raise their new born.  When a woman dies have to go back to work, child care can be costly. Here in Canada a decent day care is about 1,200 a month. That's a mortgage payment.  Rasing a child isn't just for shits and giggles, it's a full time job on top of your full time job.  You can't call in sick as a parent.  So if a woman ends up pregnant and she doesn't want to be, she should by all rights get an abortion. That's her choice. Not mine. Not yours.

Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute provide an answer. The researchers, using mathematical modeling, found that there is a tipping point for when opinions held by a committed minority spread to the rest of the population. The tipping point is 10&amp;#37;. “When the number of committed opinion holders is below 10&amp;#37;, there is no visible progress in the spread of ideas…once that number grows above 10 &amp;#37;, the idea spreads like a flame.”   Does this mean that once 10&amp;#37; of people subscribe to a MRM framework, the movement will take off?  Does the fact that more than 10&amp;#37; of people are committed feminists alter the equation?  Maybe it means that once 10&amp;#37; of people are committed MRAs, the MRM will be the default belief of Republicans/Conservatives and feminism will be the default belief of Democrats/Liberals?"

Also:  &gt;One overture (15-01) before this committee accuses Israel of practicing apartheid. This resolution, introduced by the Presbytery of Muskingum Valley in Ohio includes a damning quote attributed to former President of South Africa, Nobel-prize winning Nelson Mandela. According to the resolution, Mandela said:  &gt;&gt;&gt;Apartheid is a crime against humanity. Israel has deprived millions of Palestinians of their liberty and property. It has perpetuated a system of gross racial discrimination and inequality. It has systematically incarcerated and tortured thousands of Palestinians, contrary to the rules of international law. It has, in particular, waged a war against a civilian population, in particular children.  &gt;There’s just one problem. **Mandela never said it. The quote was in fact written by Arjan El Fassed**, an activist affiliated with Al Awda, which the ADL describes as a “grass roots organization that opposes Israel’s right to exist.” The original article in which the quote appears can be seen here. For more background about how this quote falsely attributed to Mandela, has been used by anti-Israel activists, see this brief report by Richard Landes.  &gt;Despite the inclusion of a fake quote in the text of the overture, the resolution was approved by four other PC(USA) presbyteries in the run up to the General Assembly  https://www.camera.org/article/fake-mandela-quote-gets-past-eight-pc-usa-forums/  &gt;There is another problem. While I am not a big fan of Arjan El Fassed, it needs to be mentioned that his “Mandela’s First Memo to Thomas Friedman” was sent around at a time when Friedman was writing sardonic columns containing similar concocted conversational bits. To not mention that Arjan El Fassed has repeatedly explained how the Mandela quote escaped into Internet truthiness is just not fair.   &gt;Here is the editor’s note currently posted on the Electronic Intifada website:  &gt;&gt;Editor’s note, 28 June 2013: This article was written by Arjan El Fassed in 2001 in the satirical style then being employed by Thomas Friedman, of writing mock letters from one world leader to another. Although it carries El Fassed’s byline, it has been repeatedly mistaken for an actual letter from Mandela. It is not. It is a piece of satire and has never been presented by EI as anything other than satire. El Fassed has written this history of the piece and how it subsequently was mistaken for a real letter, on his personal blog.   https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/12/13/1262588/-Mandela-Israel-Apartheid-Correcting-the-Record    &gt;In 2007 El Fassed was involved in a spoof involving a letter allegedly written by Nelson Mandela to The New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman.[1] The letter made comparison between South African apartheid to Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The memo was widely cited even by President Jimmy Carter. In 2007, political writer Joel Pollack revealed that the memo was drafted by El Fassed[2] who eventually wrote his own blog post professing that the memo was in fact his own creation.[3]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjan_El_Fassed"

Then just look at what sources they are using to figure out whether that information is credible. I’ll copy/paste my response to that person.... this info is from the [Dailymail article ](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5465541/Record-number-women-convicted-sex-crimes-Britain.html)  about this story (which a lot of people are rightfully skeptical about them too).   ——  Outright dismissing a story just because of the source writing the article is lazy ....It’s a good thing to be skeptical and confirm information is credible before believing it...  but to refuse to look at the content of a story because you don’t like that source is just closed minded.   You know, it is possible to click on an article, look at the story and see for yourself who they are getting their sources from. Then you can decide whether you think those sources are credible..  For instance, in this article...   &gt; Some 142 were guilty of sex offences in 2016 – almost double the 74 convicted two years earlier and more than triple the number at the start of the decade.   Which comes from...   &gt; Experts said the **Ministry of Justice figures** for 2016, the most recent available, reflected a change in attitudes towards women engaging in sexual contact with adolescent males – depicted as a rite of passage in films such as The Graduate.   Ministry of Justice, huh? That seems like a pretty credible source...  &gt; **Steve Lowe, director of Phoenix Forensic Consultants which treats and assesses child sex abusers, **said: ‘The rise has occurred because we are more prepared as a society to accept that women can be sexual predators and we are beginning to change our perception of the idea that a young male having sex with an adult woman is a rite of passage.   &gt; “Now we would question a 13-year-old boy having sex with a 28-year-old woman. In the past that was more likely to have been accepted. But if you reverse that, it is obvious that a 28-year-old man having sex with a 13-year-old girl is abusive.   &gt; ‘Historically, sex with an older woman was routinely seen as a positive thing for young males. It’s possible that films such as The Graduate reinforce this view. But I would never accept that. These are distorted relationships and connections.   An organization that focuses solely on studying/researching sexual abusers, huh? That seems like a pretty credible opinion about this topic.   &gt; ‘It is also likely that greater education of young males allows them to talk about having been sexually abused.’ **Dr Kieran McCartan, associate professor of criminology at the University of the West of England in Bristol**, said: ‘We are seeing an increase in the reporting, recording and sentencing of female perpetrators of sexual harm, nationally and internationally.   &gt; ‘This is down to a number of factors, including increased numbers of victims coming forward, more attuned police investigations, more cases being referred to the courts and more cases being successful.   An opinion from an associate professor of criminology at the University of the West of England in Bristol... She’s only an “associate” professor but still seems like her opinion would hold some weight.  &gt; ‘The police and the Crown Prosecution Service are being more proactive on these cases than ever before.’   &gt; The tally of 142 female sex offenders includes 16 women convicted of sexually assaulting males and 21 guilty of the same offence against women and girls.   &gt; Six were convicted of rape, 37 of sexual activity with or involving a child, one of sexual grooming, 35 for internet child pornography offences and four for exposure and voyeurism.   Statistics from the Crown Prosecution Service... that’s definitely a credible source....  ——  See.... that wasn’t so hard was it?   With the state of our current news/media organizations, it’s impossible to find sources that are 100% reliable and unbiased.... but if you take just a little bit of time and assess who/where they are getting their info from, you can decide whether or not that information is credible.   If there’s a source you’ve never heard of before, such as that ‘sexual abuser organization’... You can always google them specifically to learn more about them. Check to see if they have any biases, political leanings, where they get their funding. See if they’ve had any scandals or had anyone debunk their research before, etc etc.   And if that’s still not good enough for you, you can always google the story and find articles from other sources you trust more. All these online articles are pretty much cookie cutter versions of each other. These online publications use the same quotes/statistics from the same sources and pretty much have the same article, almost word for word. If you don’t trust this source then find an article about this story from a publication who you do trust. "

Abedin said he asked through normal channels, but that doesn't explain why Doug Band, Foundation top executive, would email her about it. I'm sure Band is very busy at the foundation, so why would he spend any time talking to the state dept about some prince's meeting with Clinton? Obviously, there isn't any explicit pay-to-play language in the emails, but Band calling the prince a ""Good friend of ours"" should certainly be a red flag. Is it really just a coincidence that so many people who met with Clinton were donors?  Also, a 2009 email shows Band directed Abedin and Mills to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with the State Department’s “substance person” on Lebanon. Band noted that Chagoury is “key guy there [Lebanon] and to us.” Chagoury has donated between $1 million to $5 million to the Foundation, according to foundation documents. He also pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative.  Again, why would a top executive of a charity be setting up a meeting for a donor with the State Dept? Where are the journalists asking these questions?"

I still think they'll vote to impeach but nobody knows for certain.   Looking back at the Mueller report, many Republicans knew he was guilty but can't acknowledge that because they'll be killed in the primaries. And Democrats decided not to pursue impeachment because they likewise feared adverse election results. I'm not saying both sides are the same, but it is interesting how parallel the motivations and cowardice are.

Every atrocity in human history has been ""legal"" at one point or another.  &gt;The benefits of living in a stable, safe democracy require taxes to find a government.  So you say, but America has existed as a relatively stable and safe democracy for more years without an income tax than with an income tax. Fun fact.  Also, at some point [the increase in taxation](https://www.lewrockwell.com/assets/2015/12/12.png) has to end. The government literally cannot tax more than 100% of GDP, although they are certainly trying to reach that point. And by then, we'll all effectively be slaves. But don't worry, it would totally be *legal*, so that makes it okay, right?  &gt;Tax policy is literally the economy  What?  &gt;the government creates the value of it's currency.  The dollar is valuable according to what people are willing to produce and trade for it. Before the US government printed US dollars, private banks issued their own dollars, which had value because people were willing to use them.  &gt;Health care has dramatically increased in cost per % of GDP over the last 50 years. Thinking that Medicare/caid is causing that is ridiculous.  The cause of healthcare price inflation is many government actions all put together. [This article](http://www.freenation.org/a/f12l3.html) is a good historical review of the beginning of government regulation of US healthcare in the early 1900's and [this article](https://mises.org/wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive) is a good followup of the regulations that came after that.  The tldr is that the US healthcare system is incredibly complex, and *all* of this complexity is unnecessarily created by various government regulations at multiple levels of government, although primarily federal. This complexity drives up costs in many ways.  &gt;Universal healthcare saves money by increasing the pool of young, healthy people to increase the the size of the fund and lower cost per insured.  You are contradicting your own argument. You do not *save money* by simply expanding the pool of people who are required to pay the bill. All that does is spread the same bill out among a larger group of people, socializing the cost while doing nothing to reduce it.  We need a change that will reduce the total bill for healthcare, not just spread it out to young people who, by the way, are the poorest group of people in the country. The young should certainly not be expected to subsidize the bills of the elderly who have had their entire lives to save up for the costs of retirement. That is certainly an economic injustice."

The midterm election will take place on November 6, 2018. 36 gubernatorial seats, 35 US senatorial seats (33 regular plus 2 special elections), all 435 voting representatives in the US House of Representatives and part or all of 87 of 99 state legislative chambers (Nebraska is the only state that has a unicameral legislature) will be up for election. The past 3 midterm elections have been ""wave"" elections where the party not controlling the White House has won at least one House of Congress, and Democrats hope to turn President Trump's first midterm election into a referendum against his policies.    As we get closer to the election, polling will become more frequent, and race prognosticators will get bolder in predicting outcomes. Below are a selection of race prognosticators and polling aggregators, spanning the ideological spectrum (although generally fairly accurate). Please feel free to discuss current polling, predictions and everything else midterm election-related in this thread. As always, please be mindful of our [commenting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil) when posting.  Voting is already underway in much of the country! 36 states have some form of early voting, and many have no-excuse early voting. [Check to see](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx) if your state's one of those to cast your ballot early.  #Race Predictions  Race prognosticators are folks who make predictions as to the outcome of the election, and assign rankings for individual races. The most frequently cited (and organizations with most reputation) are the following:  * **Cook Political Reports**: [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings) | [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings) | [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings)  * **Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball**: [Governor](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-governor/) | [Senate](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-senate/) | [House](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-house/)  * **Inside Elections***: [Governor](https://insideelections.com/ratings/governor) | [Senate](https://insideelections.com/ratings/senate) | [House](https://insideelections.com/ratings/house)  ^(*Inside Elections carries on from Stu Rothenberg's Rothenberg Reports.)  In each case, the above prognosticators are known for having connections with both parties who are willing to divulge party insider information, and have staked out a reputation from prior predictions for being accurate.  Next are a number of either recent, or partisan-leaning prognosticators that have also been cited:  * **FiveThirtyEight/ABC**: [House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/) | [Senate](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/) | [Governor](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/governor/) (quant model)  * **CNN Politics**: [Senate](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/key-races/senate/seat) | [House](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/key-races/house/seat)  * **Real Clear Politics (R-lean)**: [Governor](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/governor/2018_elections_governor_map.html) | [Senate](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/2018_elections_senate_map.html) | [House](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/house/2018_elections_house_map.html)  * **Daily Kos Elections (D)**: [Governor](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#gubernatorial) | [Senate](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#senate) | [House](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#house)  * **RRH Elections (R)**: [Governor | Senate | House | Row Officer](https://rrhelections.com/index.php/rrh-elections-race-rankings/)  * **POLITICO**: [Governor | Senate | House](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/house-senate-race-ratings-and-predictions/)  ##Rating Explanations:  * _Solid/Safe:_ Seat is not expected to change hands in the election.  * _Likely:_ Seat is unlikely to change hands, although is ""on the board"". A seat being rated ""Likely"" at the moment could also presage further shifts to more vulnerable categories later in the election. Generally, these are imagined as expecting one party to win by high single digits/double digits.  * _Lean:_ One party is likely to win, but it is not a surefire bet. In past races, candidates rated ""Lean"" have gone on to win about 70-80% of the time. Generally, these are imagined as expecting one party to win by mid to high single digits.  * _Tilt:_ Only a few prognosticators use this category. It generally means ""Tossup"", but one side is likely favored by low to mid single digits.  * _Tossup:_ Neither party is a favorite to win. In the past, about 40-60% of the time, the seat flips to the other party, accounting for certain factors in play (for instance, whether it is a ""perennial"" vulnerable seat, where a politician is better at appealing across the aisle and surviving). Generally, these are imagined as expecting the ultimate spread to be low single digits for either party.  #Latest Polls  * [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/)  * [Polling Report](http://www.pollingreport.com/)  * [Political Polling (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/PpollingNumbers)  * [Politics_Polls (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Politics_Polls)  Polls generally can't be compared in an apples to apples fashion. Check out **[FiveThirtyEight's pollster ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/)** to get a sense of pollster [house effects](https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/calculating-house-effects-of-polling-firms/), prior performance and reliability.    #Early Vote  Many states keep tabs of votes as they come in, and there are resources around that keep track of how those votes come in. Below are a few state-specific and general projects of this sort:  * [Elect Project](http://www.electproject.org/) (Nationwide)  * [Texas Tribune](https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2018/general-election-early-voting/) (TX)  * [Michael Li](https://twitter.com/mcpli) (Brennan Center, also many TX stats)  * [Jon Ralston](https://twitter.com/RalstonReports) (NV)  * [Steve Schale](http://steveschale.com/) (FL)  * [Election Smith](https://twitter.com/electionsmith/) (FL)  * [Georgia Votes](http://georgiavotes.com/) (GA)  * [Old North State Politics](https://twitter.com/oldnorthstpol/) (NC)  With the exception of a couple states, the early vote is difficult to use as a way of divining whether a party is ahead or not. Factors that make this difficult include when party members are more likely to return ballots (Republicans return ballots earlier, Democrats and infrequent voters tend to return them later), the timing of certain events (Democratic black churches organize ""souls to the polls"" events after Sunday services in the lead up to the vote in many Southern states), and even how states ""register"" a vote (eg. Ohio does not have ""true"" voter registration - it is which party primary you last voted in; North Dakota does not have voter registration at all). In some states, early voting is also relatively recent and does not yet form a large fraction of the total vote. As always, short of states where an overwhelming number of ballots are cast early, there is always uncertainty as to whether a party is ""cannibalizing"" election day voters and simply turning out voters early who would vote anyways - this doesn't tell us much about whether a candidate is ahead or not.   #Register to Vote  Democracy isn't a spectator sport! If you're eligible to vote in the midterm election, please do so. Each election has consequences, regardless of what party you are affiliated with.  * [Federal Voter Assistance Program](https://www.fvap.gov/)  * [U.S. Election Assistance Commission](https://www.eac.gov/voters/resourcesforvoters/)  * [No Excuses Vote](https://theskimm.com/noexcuses)  * [Rock The Vote](https://www.rockthevote.org/)  * [DMV](https://www.dmv.org/)  * [Vote.org](https://www.vote.org/)  * [Vote 411](https://www.vote411.org/)"

The end of this article talks about how Cohen and Sater were, in May 2016, discussing traveling to Russia and how they had been formally invited by Russian government officials. **Cohen said he planned to travel before the Republican Convention (which began on July 18).**  The Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyer, supposedly about obtaining Clinton emails, **occurred in June 2016**  Cohen traveled to Italy **from July 9 to July 17, 2016.** Sure seems very unusual that Trump would let his lawyer/one of his closest advisors go on a personal vacation for the 9 days leading up to one of the most important campaign events don’t you think??? Cohen claims he was in Capri, Italy on vacation with family and friends, including E Street band member Steve van Zandt.   According to [this thread from Seth Abramson](https://mobile.twitter.com/sethabramson/status/994064186501189633), **Van Zandt’s wife claims they never left Rome and were not in Capri with Michael Cohen.**  When Glenn Simpson testified to Congress, he talked about how Cohen’s Italy trip was suspicious, because he refused to provide any documents or records or things like receipts/credit card statements that could easily prove that he did not travel from Italy **to Prague or somewhere else in the Schengen area that would not require a passport stamp.**  Reporters and investigators need to talk to Steve van Zandt and get him on the record as to whether he was actually with Cohen. His Italy travel is a huge red flag and could very well be the secret Prague trip referenced in the dossier, where he supposedly went to pay hackers and cover up the operation. **[This 2016 article](http://tass.com/politics/886584/amp?__twitter_impression=true) confirms that the Russian man who the dossier alleges was the one to facilitate Cohen’s meetings with hackers was in Italy around the same days as Cohen.**  Finally, note that Carter Page was in Moscow on **July 8,** and he has told different versions of what he was actually doing on that trip.

This is just once drop in the bucket of the U.S. fucking around in the middle east, with cultures, people, and goverments we only thought we understood and EVERY TIME we made the fuckup even worse.

After 9/11 happened W. Bush and crew put the spin that Iraq was a major player in the attack, and that they had WMDs, and long story short no... we invaded them for no real reason, killed Hussain because we didn't like him in power, and [basically fucked shit up](https://www.globalpolicy.org/humanitarian-issues-in-iraq/consequences-of-the-war-and-occupation-of-iraq.html) both for the Iraqi people and our own military vets.

Anyway, my point is the U.S. has a bit of a dirty history of low ball fucking with groups and governments to try to get the outcome we want, and when shit destabilizes and goes all south, then we use that as an excuse to invade. I'm COMPLETELY simplifying this. It's a lot more complicated but... it is some shit we do.

(Not even as sexual assualt, as in case of UK- which itself is biased)  There is absolutely no right a man has in USA, that woman doesn't have legally speaking.

And yet the Ueno et. al paper you've cited above states that such increases would have a positive impact on cloud formation.  &gt;The WM intensification interval correlates with the cooling event in Osaka Bay[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR6),[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR37), ascribable to the major decrease in the earth’s magnetic dipole field to &lt;25% of the present strength from 783 to 776 ka (Fig. [4i](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#Fig4))[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR38), from which large increases in GCR flux, by 50‒80%, can be estimated (Fig. [4j](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#Fig4))[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR39). The increased GCR flux would have induced an increase in low-cloud cover[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR7),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45466-8#ref-CR8), possibly resulting in intensification of the WM through an umbrella effect.   So which is it?  The Ueno et. al. paper also does nothing to support your belief that changes in GCRF have a role to play in the recent warming we're experiencing. For one thing the effect is in the opposite direction: per the above, they posit a reduction in temperature due to increases in low level cloud cover.  For another, the time scales are way off what you'd need to support your rather interesting theory. From the quote above, you can see that this event took place over thousands of years.  If there was indeed a link between cosmic rays and temperature, we should be able to see that a change in the former had an impact on the latter. There is no such correlation however (see the Benestad paper, figure 2 above). GCRF is strongly correlated to solar cycles - reaching the lowest levels at solar activity peaks - but not to temperature.  Onward.  &gt;The onset of Hirnantian glaciation was likely controlled by mechanisms and feedbacks that lead to falling *p*CO2   This doesn't invalidate the link between CO2 and warmer temperatures. Or a lack of CO2 and cooler temperatures. As the paper you've cited states:  &gt;Elevated *p*CO2 (8× PAL) for the early Late Ordovician appears to have balanced the reduced solar flux from a fainter Sun, resulting in mean global surface temperatures that approach those of the present day   Can I assume that by citing this paper you accept that CO2 has a direct relationship to temperature? Sadly they didn't mention anything about GCRF. I can't imagine why. Maybe they don't get paid to do appearances for the Heartland Institute like old mate Shaviv does.  &gt;haha   Indeed."

The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيرة الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by an American public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah's testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda.[1][2]  Again, this stuff is real -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model  **Pulitzer Prize winning article** - https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html  (Poor) Wikipedia summary of the article - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program  Even more proof of television news propaganda - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird"

Table 2.2 on p. 19 shows that 1.267 million men reported being made to penetrate in a 12-month period.   And here from p. 24: “For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%).”  So being made to penetrate someone else is a form of sexual violence, equal in frequency to rape, and most of the time women are the perpetrators.

This kind of heuristic reconstruction comes from the qualitative geological record which gives indications of glaciations and hothouses, but is not really adequate for quantitative reconstructions of global mean temperatures. Over the last few decades, much better geochemical proxy compilations with better dating have appeared (for instance, [Royer et al (2004)](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/#ITEM-17010-2)) and the idea that there are only two long-term climate states has long fallen by the wayside.  However, since this graphic has long been a favorite of the climate dismissives, many different versions do the rounds, mostly forwarded by people who have no idea of the provenance of the image or the lack of underlying data, or the updates that have occurred. Indeed, the 2004 version is the most common, having been given a boost by [Monckton in 2008](http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/200807/monckton.cfm) and many others. Most recently, [Patrick Moore](https://twitter.com/ecosensenow/status/442424174477201408) declared that this was his favorite graph.""  For example, the graph shows CO2 falling uniformly from the middle Cretaceous through the Eocene (approximately the 164 Ma to 44 mya period you refer to), that is not the case:  Glikson, A. (2016).

An early Cenozoic perspective on greenhouse warming and carbon-cycle dynamics. *Nature*, *451*(7176), 279-283.  ""The Cenozoic era, the last 65 million years of Earth's history, provides an ideal backdrop from which to understand relationships between carbon cycling and climate. In contrast to the present day, much of the early Cenozoic was characterized by noticeably higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, as well as a much warmer mean global temperature and poles with little or no ice[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06588#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06588#ref-CR6) ([Fig. 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06588#Fig2)). The extreme case is the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), 51–53 million years ago, when pCO2 was high and global temperature reached a long-term maximum. Only over the past 34 million years have CO2 concentrations been low, temperatures relatively cool, and the poles glaciated.""  Royer, D. L. (2006). CO2-forced climate thresholds during the Phanerozoic. *Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta*, *70*(23), 5665-5675.  ""The correspondence between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and globally averaged surface temperatures in the recent past suggests that this coupling may be of great antiquity. Here, I compare 490 published proxy records of CO2 spanning the Ordovician to Neogene with records of global cool events to evaluate the strength of CO2-temperature coupling over the Phanerozoic (last 542 my). For periods with sufficient CO2 coverage, all cool events are associated with CO2 levels below 1000 ppm. A CO2 threshold of below ∼500 ppm is suggested for the initiation of widespread, continental glaciations, although this threshold was likely higher during the Paleozoic due to a lower solar luminosity at that time. Also, based on data from the Jurassic and Cretaceous, a CO2 threshold of below ∼1000 ppm is proposed for the initiation of cool non-glacial conditions. A pervasive, tight correlation between CO2 and temperature is found both at coarse (10 my timescales) and fine resolutions up to the temporal limits of the data set (million-year timescales), indicating that CO2, operating in combination with many other factors such as solar luminosity and paleogeography, has imparted strong control over global temperatures for much of the Phanerozoic.""  Also some very sloppy writing by the author:  ""in the Palaeozoic Era, for example, the concentration of Carbon Dioxide dropped below 210 ppmV. Throughout the Permian Period plant and animal species diverged and diversified as never before. Dinosaurs prospered and predominated over all the other orders of vertebrates.""  No sources. Why is he capitalizing carbon dioxide? Finally, there were no fucking dinosaurs in the Permian.  "" From the early Triassic to the middle Cretaceous, the concentration of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide was similar to its current density.""  Doesn't even match his Figure 1. No sources.  &gt;It is possible that the concentration of atmospheric CO2 will increase normally in the course of the next 50 million years to 1050 ppmV or 2500 ppmV.  It's possible pigs will fly.  &gt;the present increase of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide was caused by an extraordinary increase in solar activity in 1998 which warmed up the El Niño South Atlantic Oceanic Oscillation.

I have, and they're good. Now let's look at how that impacts the budget.  In 2015, the Federal Spending was $3.8 trillion. We accrued $3.25 trillion in tax revenue. That's a difference of $550 billion. So even if you take the high end of military spending reform proposals from CATO, you still don't make up the difference in the budget that leads to a deficit.

Local media reports that the shooting took place at a Rock Hill, South Carolina home, where police found the bodies of Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70, and his wife, Barbara Lesslie, 69, dead, along with their grandchildren Adah and Noah Lesslie, who were 5 and 9. Rock Hill police have identified the victims as Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70, and his wife, Barbara Lesslie, 69. The couple was found inside of their home. Another man who was working at the home, James Lewis, was found dead outside, and police say a sixth person was hospitalized with serious gunshot wounds. However, police have yet to release the name of the suspected shooter, prompting an anonymous source to speak to the media instead. According to Count On 2 News, “The source,  https://www.counton2.com/news/south-carolina-news/3-adults-2-children-found-dead-at-york-county-home-2/  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said Adams’ parents live near the doctor’s home in Rock Hill, and that he had been treated by the doctor.

I've written a post about it.  **Death anxiety, higher life expectancy and new technology made people support lockdown, I think. Thoughts?**  &gt;"" For ca. 20 days ago I asked ""[Why are only a few lockdown skeptical? How can views be so different on the virus and lockdown?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kc1ets/why_are_only_a_few_lockdown_skeptical_how_can/)"". I've not found a definitive answer on why our views are so differently and I don't think I will find an answer soon either. I can just speculate and I do have theories. I've also theories on why the lockdown as an idea appeals more to more people now and why there hasn't been a similar lockdown like this in the past.   &gt;   &gt;Why lockdown happen in the modern world   &gt;   &gt;According to my theory the changes that happen during the industrial revolution and after it had an impact on how humans started living their lives, what they thought and expected. **In the last couple of centuries living expectancy has risen, technology has changed, some countries have become wealthier and the living standards have for many modernized.** In many countries it's not uncommon to live till you're 80 years old. **Medical technology** may have increased many people's living spans. Examples on something that got invented were new medicines/shots (E.g. insulin, chemotherapy, antibiotic), anesthesia so otherwise painful procedure became possible to do and advanced surgeries. An example on advanced surgeries that didn't exist in the past are organ transplantations. With **modernized living standards** I mean **electricity, plumbing and internet** have become more common. It's not only the wealthiest people who've an indoor bathroom, lighting bulbs and TVs. Low income families can also have these things. With plumbing and electricity it's easier to stay warm, keep a high hygiene standards, cook and store food because of fridges and freezers. The food standards have improved. Another thing that has become more common is **secularism**. Although many in the world are still religious, the numbers of people who believes there isn't a life after death and this is the only chance we got increases. I can't give you an explanation on why religion has decreased.   &gt;   &gt;So, my point is that our living standards, life expectancy and technology have changed. (Source: [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/12/23/14062168/history-global-conditions-charts-life-span-poverty), [BBC.com](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving), [NYC times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/2017-progress-illiteracy-poverty.html)) **It can affect our expectations to life, our views on death and the way we're reacting to diseases.** Many humans are afraid of death and I think these ones who lives in modern, wealthier countries have a bigger need of controlling it than what previous generations and these ones in the poorest countries have. The reason is because of new technology that saves more lives and a bigger wealth, so they think they can afford it. Some countries have become wealthier since WW2. With **internet**, someone may think it's easier to do **remote schooling, working from home and socializing**. That are something that wasn't possible before the internet's invention. With **laundry machines** and **plumbing**, it's expected of everyone to keep a **different hygiene standard than the past**. With improved medical technology there are higher pressure on doctors to save lives and modern society has maybe become **less accepting of dying**. There may be a goal to live as long as possible and save as many as possible.   &gt;   &gt;Danger is relative?   &gt;   &gt;I also think many have a **different view on danger now than in the past** because of the world has changed. **War, poverty and diseases** with high mortality rate **still exists** and happen, but it's **lesser** now than in the 1900s. Many of us have never experienced wars like the grandparent generations and extreme poverty with no access to electricity or plumbing. Many haven't experienced diseases like the 1918 flu or the plague, like people from other centuries. When you've not experienced these things yourself and media writes big headlines about a new virus, it would look more dangerous and threatening. In a way danger is relative. Someone who lived in the early 1900s may find COVID19 as less scary because of they've experienced or witnessed worse diseases. People who've not witnessed it are more likely to have different views. From my own experience, the older generation tends to hope doctors would make them better and they would survive, but know they're just humans with limitations and the younger generation often expects it happen like magic. Exceptions exists of course. It's just something I've noticed.   &gt;   &gt;Why some may be more likely to support lockdown than others   &gt;   &gt;I think **wealth, living standards** and your situation may **affect** your **views** on **lockdown**. To be honest, most of us tends to think about ourselves firstly. Someone who has a good economy, can work from home comfortably and lives in a household they're happy with tends to be more comfortable with a lockdown than these ones without these things. At the same time they may be more concerned about dying of COVID19 themselves or someone they loves dying of it, although the survival rate is high, simply because of it's the risk they can think about. They don't see the risk of food insecurity if they've a stable WFH job, for example. For someone who is poor or homeless, has lost their job, is lonely and struggle with mental health - the risk of dying of COVID19 seems very small in comparison. Food insecurity, not feeling safe because of lack of social support and mental health seems like bigger threats. I guess that may play a role. I may or may not be right.   &gt;   &gt;**Everyday I've asked myself these questions, as a lockdown skeptic.** Why are some more likely to support lockdown than others? Why does it seem like lockdown is more appealing to people today than in the past? Why haven't I heard about lockdown similar to this one in the past? I don't know. These ones are just my theories. I may or may not be right. **I would like to hear your thoughts.**"""

The epidemiologists who have known the infection fatality rate from early on were able to guess that from the cruise ship that had an outbreak on it and the passengers weren't allowed to disembark as the virus made it's way through a closed population:  *""Ioannidis then zooms in on the “one situation” where “an entire, closed population was tested”: the Diamond Princess cruise ship’s quarantined passengers. While the fatality rate was 1.0%, he points out, the population was largely elderly, the most at-risk demographic. Projected out onto the age structure of the U.S. population,*  **he calculates, the death rate is more like 0.125%, with a range of 0.025% to 0.625% based on the sample size:**   *Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%). It is also possible that some of the passengers who were infected might die later, and that tourists may have different frequencies of chronic diseases — a risk factor for worse outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection — than the general population.* **Adding these extra sources of uncertainty, reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.**   *“That huge range markedly affects how severe the pandemic is and what should be done,”* **Ioannidis stresses. “A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza. If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational.** *It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.”*   *For those who argue that the high fatality rate among elderly people indicates that the death rate cannot be as low as 0.05%, the professor notes that* **“even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes.”**  Source: https://www.dailywire.com/news/stanford-professor-data-indicates-were-overreacting-to-coronavirus?itm_source=parsely-api   And this particular epidemiologist was correct in his estimates from March because as the pandemic progressed and he was able to crunch more data, his previous IFR matches the current one which is peer-reviewed and published on the WHO's website:  **""COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%):** the rate was 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (&lt; 118 deaths/million), 0.20% in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people and 0.57% in locations with &gt; 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people.  **In people &lt; 70 years, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31% with crude and corrected medians of 0.05%"".**  Source: https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf"

As communities become comprised of different peoples, the culture and politics of those communities become an expression of their constituent peoples.  &gt; You’ll often encounter doomsday rhetoric in alt-right online communities: that’s because many of them instinctively feel that once large enough and ethnically distinct enough groups are brought together, they will inevitably come to blows. In short, they doubt that full “integration” is ever possible. If it is, it won’t be successful in the “kumbaya” sense. Border walls are a much safer option  That's right: these men are literally incapable of comprehending the concept of decency; in their minds, ""all men are created equal"" is a _frightening_ notion, because they simply can't imagine anyone could be better than themselves.

This means you have different subsets of the population becoming susceptible again in any given year or season.  The disease is therefore able to perpetuate itself permanently (it is in ""endemic equilibrium"").

Isn't it totally against modern  DR's suggestions to sleep in the bed with your baby?    And if it seemed like sleep positioning caused the death, then why would the coroner spend hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars to look into vaccine related issues.  So the coroner is not some evil person out to protect Big Pharma, he's just some honest guy doing his job, and when it looks like positional asphyixation, well then don't do thousands of dollars of random tests in case it was the boogeyman.    I thought it was just a tragic SIDS death, with an upset mother becoming more upset at a lack of answers.  But that examiner's conclusions shows that this mother is almost certainly acting out against something that did not cause the death, and even more sadly, is now profiting from that death, via 'merch' and other donations."

And I am not extrovert. I am a introvertic loner. but this shit is getting to me... I would never suspect myself reacting so badly.  talking over screens doesnt cut it either.

If you were to come to grips with the uncomfortable reality of how often innocent people are falsely convicted of heinous crimes, how biased the American ""justice"" systems is (just look at the politicization of THE SUPREME COURT, you don't think that happens at lower levels? Some judge who's up for re-election wanting to look tough on crime? or who just believes QAnon bullshit? Or has a religious or racial bias? look at the red scare, or the satanic panic for evidence of the justice system losing its goddamned mind entirely ) ... you might change your stance.  Besides that, the basic science is, death has proven ineffective as a deterrent and may cause more murders as criminals are more likely to kill witnesses.   To your point too it frequently costs the state more to kill someone than to keep them in prison for life, so even if you're putting money over lives... keep them in jail. (and it's not completely clear cut, it doesn't make intuitive sense, and raises a lot of ""but if things were different... Because it 'shouldn't' cost more to kill someone than keep them in jail' but tough shit, that's the situation we have to work with ) https://ballotpedia.org/Fact_check/Is_the_death_penalty_more_expensive_than_life_in_prison  New evidence comes to light all the time, corrupt judges are found out, laws change, and you can always release people from prison, but you can't releases someone from the grave. That and the described frequently inhuman way many death row inmates are killed because even big pharma won't play along with execution as a punishment."

Secondly, the rioters that attacked the Capitol and have subsequently been arrested have claimed that the president asked for them to be there - so at some level his speech is encouraging physical attacks.  Thirdly, the actual speech: [https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial)  His speech is not about calming people down and accepting defeat gracefully. He repeatedly (and falsely) claims the election is stolen. He repeatedly claims that ""we"" are not going to take this anymore.  Fourthly, during Trump's speech, the audience chanted ""Fight for Trump"" - and he didn't tell them to be peaceful (NB: He uses the words Fight/Fighting 20 times).  **He got people riled up and directed them to march on the Capitol.**"

DeJoy already [said](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/retreat-dejoy-suspends-usps-changes-until-after-election-n1237140) they’d halt the changes and stated they would be delayed until after the election.   &gt;In blocking DeJoy’s changes, U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian said the USPS changes amounted to “a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service,” and there is “a substantial possibility many voters will be disenfranchised.”  This is all conjecture and is not proven.   &gt;The specifics of the injunction are not yet released, but the AGs’ request for a preliminary injunction specifically asked the court to stop a directive requiring mail trucks to leave on time—which has resulted in mail getting left behind—require the USPS to treat all election mail as first class mail and require all sorting equipment that has been removed or disconnected to be reimplemented.  Can’t argue with specifics that aren’t released now can we?  But why stop trucks from leaving on time? Why is that an issue? Don’t we expect a service to be on time?  As far as being able to handle mail-in ballots, the post office has stated they are fully [capable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-11/postal-service-can-handle-a-surge-of-mail-in-ballots-u-s-says) of doing so.   &gt;The injunction also asked the USPS to “abide by” a recent directive from DeJoy that temporarily paused some of his changes through the election.  Noted above. This changes nothing that wasn’t already happening.   &gt;DeJoy has repeatedly defended his changes to the agency and insisted the USPS has the capacity to handle election mail, and the postmaster general reiterated his commitment to running trucks on time in a video to USPS employees released Thursday hours before the ruling.  And again, already addressed above.   So this case was basically just a political statement to accuse DeJoy of playing politics with the mail?"

Example:  [The CIA threat to journalists that wasn't](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/the-truth-about-the-wikileaks-cia-cache.html). Wikileaks posts a tweet saying that CIA malware can ""bypass"" a common way of securing communications via encryption. Journalists then reported this as saying the CIA could *break* that encryption method. There was a CIA malware tool, but it did not target encrypted communication at all. It targeted the information held on an individual phone. The more accurate summary would have been ""If the C.I.A. goes after your specific phone and hacks it, the agency can look at its content."".  How many ""revelations"" from Wikileaks are like this? I think pretty much all of them, personally."

I'll add that only 297 people were killed by all rifles in 2018.    Most gun violence is gang related in cities with the most restricive infringements of our rights.  From hitemlow:  Here's my usual dump, should make a decent starting point.  The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America  Rifles killed 297 people last year. That's ANY type of rifle and ANY instance in which it was used - whether that be home defense, gang activity, mass shootings, etc.  Fists and feet killed 700.  Knives killed 1,500.  Guns aren't the problem, especially rifles  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls  There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)  U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)  Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.  Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.  What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:  • 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)  • 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)  • 489 (2%) are accidental (5)  So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.  Still too many? Let's look at location:  298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)  327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)  328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)  764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)  That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.  This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others  Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...  But what about other deaths each year?  70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)  49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)  37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)  Now it gets interesting:  250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!  610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).  A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.  Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!  We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.  Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.  https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15  Page 15:  Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).  That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including suicides. (Which account for over 75% of all deaths by gun  Older study, 1995:  https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc  Page 164  The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns.

[Here's a Breitbart article from **yesterday** that claims that Obama had wire tapped Trump Tower.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/mark-levin-obama-used-police-state-tactics-undermine-trump/amp/)  The arguments it makes are very dubious and it comes to a solid conclusion based on sources that really only offer hearsay, and even the conclusions of their sources are very dubious.  One of the most important sources appears to be [this National Review article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443768/obama-fisa-trump-wiretap) which doesn't come to anything like the conclusion that Breitbart ends up making (surprise, surprise).  Breitbart claims that there is evidence that the FBI were eavesdropping on the Trump campaign whereas the National Review article claims the FBI had a limited warrant to listen to specific communication from Trump Tower not including Trump himself's communication. (They make the claim that the FISA warrant is directed at the mysterious server contacting Russia that has now become infamous).  (As an aside to this I'm also going to postulate that Trump had a busy day yesterday and didn't find enough time to binge the news so took an opportunity to do that this morning. His other tweets around the same time are also making reference to topics that were raised by news articles yesterday, such as [the Russian ambassador having made 22 visits to the White House.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/russian-ambassador-visited-obama-white-house-22-times/amp/) Either or that or Bannon is getting news fed to him by his former employees and is whispering it in Trump's ear)  Edit: Just to give people my theorised timeline of Trump's morning:  Just beore 3:30 in the morning Trump read [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/state-department-sponsored-sessions-meeting-with-russian-ambassador/) article from Breitbart. He decided to take the opportunity to clear Sessions' name and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837987684660412416) at 3:26am.  He then skimmed through [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/state-department-sponsored-sessions-meeting-with-russian-ambassador/) article from Breitbart. He was outraged by it and had to [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106) about it at 3:35am. (For those claiming that this was obviously from Trump's investigations into FISA warrants and not from Breitbart, why in the world would Trump not tweet about this when he was made aware of it? And why the hell would he send a tweet in defence of Sessions before tweeting about this?)  He then flicked through to [this](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/03/03/russian-ambassador-visited-obama-white-house-22-times) article from Breitbart and has to [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106) out his defence of Sessions again at 3:42am.  But he was still outraged by the second story and sent out tweets number [four](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837993273679560704), [five](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837994257566863360) and [six](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837996746236182529) between 3:49am and 4:02 am.  He then calmed down for a bit and came back for some [celebrity news](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/03/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-quits-celebrity-apprentice-one-season-cites-shows-baggage/) and had to let off some steam by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/838016045222854656) that Schwarzenegger was fired from the Apprentice rather than quit at 5:19am. Not sure what happened in the hour long gap between tweets."

The mink farms got millions infected with covid, they passed it among one another. It mutated and returned to humans.   &gt; Since June 2020, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks, including 12 cases with a unique variant, reported on 5 November. All 12 cases were identified in September 2020 in North Jutland, Denmark. The cases ranged in age from 7 to 79 years, and eight had a link to the mink farming industry and four cases were from the local community.  Initial observations suggest that the clinical presentation, severity and transmission among those infected are similar to that of other circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. However, this variant, referred to as the ""cluster 5"" variant, had a combination of mutations, or changes that have not been previously observed. The implications of the identified changes in this variant are not yet well understood. Preliminary findings indicate that this particular mink-associated variant identified in both minks and the 12 human cases has moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Further scientific and laboratory-based studies are required to verify preliminary findings reported and to understand any potential implications of this finding in terms of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in development. In the meantime, actions are being taken by Danish authorities to limit the further spread of this variant of the virus among mink and human populations.  https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-november-2020-mink-associated-sars-cov2-denmark/en/  &gt; In fact, in 2007 an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health was published on the topic, worrying that our mass-raising and slaughtering of animals for food could be the genesis of the next big global pandemic. Given the connection between industrial animal agriculture and pandemic risk, the American Public Health Association journal editorial observed: “It is curious, therefore, that changing the way humans treat animals—most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten—is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.""  https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/one-root-cause-of-pandemics-few-people-think-about/"

No out for child support forces a man to spend years of his life working to pay for a child he does not want.  If he loses his job and is unable to pay, he will be locked in a cage.  1 in 8 men in South Carolina jails are there for failure to pay child support. They are not given court appointed lawyers until they are $10k behind and most are arrested and lose their job way before that limit making it extremely difficult to pay.

I do not believe there has yet been a single case where a boy or man has gotten out of paying child support to an adult woman that statutory raped, raped, sperm jacked, etc.  The good news is that in recent years feminist lobbiests have pushed for laws to prevent rapists from getting child custody. Without custody the child wouldn't be raised by a rapist and the victim wouldn't owe child support. So the day that a male doesn't owe his perpetrator may be coming soon. The less good news is that just over half the states that passed these laws passed them as the feminist lobbiests proposed them - only preventing rapist **fathers** from getting custody.

Under the new legislation, it is illegal for anyone except poll workers to provide food or water to voters in line for polls.  &gt;	The law reads: “No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method...or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector.”  &gt;	“This prohibition is a part of a number of different prohibitions that make it more difficult to do politicking at the polls,” Segall explained.   &gt;	But Segall says it’s very unlikely that this law will be enforced.  Yes it is illegal for anyone who is not a poll works to hand out food or water to voters in line, but as a way to keep people from attempting to garner more votes by doing so. They also still allow unmanned water stations (water fountains, etc.) at polling locations. Poll workers could still go out and hand out snacks or water if it was a need.   No one is going to be punished if they’re standing in line and they have a bottle of water and they hand it to their friend that came with them.   And I don’t see people having to bring their own provisions as a barrier to voting.   &gt;	 This means regardless of absentee ballots, single parents and working class have to schedule time off work if they work Mon-Friday, 9-5. This reduces the availability of drop box hours to 25% what it was in 2020.  “However, the law did make some changes to early voting. But experts say the net effect was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them.”  “One of the biggest changes in the bill would expand early voting access for most counties, adding an additional mandatory Saturday and formally codifying Sunday voting hours as optional,” Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting said in an excellent and comprehensive report on the impact of the new law. “Counties can have early voting open as long as 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at minimum. If you live in a larger metropolitan county, you might not notice a change. For most other counties, you will have an extra weekend day, and your weekday early voting hours will likely be longer.”  “During the 2020 election, for instance, vote-rich Fulton County, with a substantial Black population, set early-voting hours at 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on most weekdays and two Saturdays, though the last weekdays had 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. voting hours. Voting was allowed on two Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m.”  “Under the new law, Fulton County could set the exact same hours for in-person early voting — or expand them from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day.”  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/biden-falsely-claims-new-georgia-law-ends-voting-hours-early/  Yes the number of boxes are drastically decreased which is inconvenient I can concede to that, but it also opens up a mandatory Saturday with an optional Sunday for early voting which opens the available drop boxes on those days as well. With extended early voting, there may not be as much of a need for said boxes.    I can’t read your last 2 articles because of paywalls but based on what you’re saying I can see why those would seem like knee jerk reactions to losing an election. Although I think that even with the reduction in times regarding the absentee ballets, I think the limits are still plenty and don’t really pose any unfair advantage, though I can see why people might not like a reduction in time of any amount.   Just like with every law of course there are going to be issues with it, but it is not the Jim Crow era policy that Biden is trying to make it out to be.   If people argued against it from the last two angles I’d be a little more understanding but the argument I see 99% of the time is against requiring an ID to vote."

They still quote the article which concludes, that people of colore are three times more likely to experience violence","You’ve been manipulated and lied to.  https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/09/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say/  “One might retort that, while it may be rare for a black man to be killed by the police, black men are still constantly stopped and routinely brutalized by the police, even if they don’t die from it. However, even this weaker claim is false. It just isn’t true that black men are kicked, punched, etc., on a regular basis by the police.  In order to show that, I’m going to use data from the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), which, as its name suggests, provides detailed information about contacts between the police and the public. It’s conducted on a regular basis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and is based on a nationally representative sample of more than 70,000 U.S. residents age 16 or older. Respondents are asked whether they had a contact with the police during the past 12 months; if they say they did, they answer a battery of questions about the nature of their last contact, including any use of force. Since the respondents also provide their age, race, gender, etc., we can use this survey to calculate the prevalence of police violence for various demographic groups. The numbers in this piece are from my own analysis of the data, the details and code for which I provide here, but they are consistent with a 2015 report compiled by the BJS itself to the extent the two overlap.  First, despite what the narrative claims, it’s not true that black men are constantly stopped by the police for no reason. Indeed, black men are less likely than white men to have contact with the police in any given year, though this includes situations where the respondent called the cops himself: 17.5 percent versus 20.7 percent. Similarly, a black man has on average only 0.32 contacts with the police in any given year, compared with 0.35 contacts for a white man. It’s true that black men are overrepresented among people who have many contacts with the police, but not by much. Only 1.5 percent of black men have more than three contacts with the police in any given year, whereas 1.2 percent of white men do.  If we look at how often the police use physical force against men of different races, we find that there is indeed a racial disparity, but that this experience is rare across the board. Only 0.6 percent of black men experience physical force by the police in any given year, while approximately 0.2 percent of white men do. To be fair, these are probably slight undercounts, because the survey does not allow us to identify people who did not experience physical force during their most recent contact but did experience such force during a previous contact in the same year.  Further, physical force as defined by the PPCS includes relatively mild forms of violence such as pushing and grabbing. Actual injuries by the police are so rare that one cannot estimate them very precisely even in a survey as big as the PPCS, but the available data suggest that only 0.08 percent of black men are injured by the police each year, approximately the same rate as for white men. A black man is about 44 times as likely to suffer a traffic-related injury, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Moreover, keep in mind that these tallies of police violence include violence that is legally justified.  Now, it’s true that there are significant differences in the rates at which men of different races experience police violence — 0.6 percent is triple 0.2 percent. However, although people often equate racial disparities with bias, this inference is fallacious, as can be seen through an analogy with gender: Men are vastly more likely to experience police violence than women are, but while bias may explain part of this disparity, nobody doubts that most of it has to do with the fact that men are on average far more violent than women. Similarly, if black men commit violent crimes at much higher rates than white men, that might have a lot to do with the disparity in the use of force by the police.  This is evident in the National Crime Victimization Survey, another survey of the public conducted by the BJS. Interviewers ask respondents if they have been the victim of a crime in the past 12 months; if they have, respondents provide information about the nature of the incidents, including the race and ethnicity of the offenders. This makes it possible to measure racial differences in crime rates without relying on data from the criminal-justice system, in which racial bias could lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction for black men even if they commit violence at the same rate.  NCVS data from 2015, the most recent year available, suggest that black men are three times as likely to commit violent crimes as white men. To the extent that cops are more likely to use force against people who commit violent crimes, which they surely are, this could easily explain the disparities we have observed in the rates at which the police use force. That’s not to say that bias plays no role; I’m sure it does play one. But it’s unlikely to explain a very large part of the discrepancy.  Some might say that, instead of consulting statistics like these, we should defer to black Americans’ own perceptions of how the police treat them. As various polls have demonstrated, black people are much more likely than white people to think that police violence against minorities is very common. But the issue cannot be settled this way.  Since individuals have direct knowledge of what happened to them personally, you can trust them about that. But when it comes to larger social phenomena, people’s beliefs are influenced by far more than just their personal experience, including the media. The far more compelling fact is that, if you draw a representative sample of the population and ask each black man in that sample whether a police officer has used physical force against him in the past year, you find that it’s extremely rare.”  https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/the-institutional-racism-canard/   https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=14    https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/06/03/bob_woodson_democrats_use_racism_to_deflect_attention_from_failing_cities_theyve_run_for_50_years.html"

Now, let's talk Pfizer:  &gt; ""Pfizer is a very large company with substantial cash reserves,"" Goodman said. ""I'm sure that [OWS] was helpful. I'm not sure about [whether] it wouldn't have happened without it.""  &gt; Walter Orenstein, a former director of the U.S. Immunization Program and former deputy director for immunization programs at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, said Operation Warp Speed has played a major role by guaranteeing a market to Pfizer so it can begin developing its procedures for distribution.  &gt; He agreed that the policy initiative is an exception to how the Trump administration has handled the pandemic and that his ""personal opinion is [OWS] has helped substantially.""  &gt; ""I can't see this large an effort by this many companies going forward in this fashion without substantial support that has come [through] Operation Warp Speed.""  Of course OWS and Pfizer don't have a perfect relationship, but please stop saying they have no involvement or didn't help. *You* might say they didn't help based on your personal perception of what is truly ""helpful,"" but if the experts are saying it helped, then obviously I'm going to take their word over your opinion."

Why? * Tremendous success has been seen in Covid-19 patients in  Madagascar. In an and interview with FRANCE 24 and RFI, Madagascar’s  President Andry Rajoelina defended his promotion of a controversial  homegrown remedy for Covid-19 despite an absence of clinical trials. “It  works really well,” he said of the herbal drink “Covid-Organics.” They  are, as the president expressed, herbs that have been brewed to extract  their medicinal properties. He explains that his country has been doing  things this way for a very long time, and they’ve always worked.

And I thought I would post this here as its a good time to discuss something called Gamma Bias, which I am sure most people would not have heard of, and is useful to now when considering identity politics and SJW's as it explains a lot of they motivations.  SO....  The new report: (lol its not by dailymail, its a study, but im linking daily mail)  [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9102585/COVID-19-Countries-led-women-NOT-fared-significantly-better-pandemic.html?login#newcomment)  The original claim (women leaders better handled pandemic which was falsely claimed by a study then cited bu UN, WEF, Times, Guardian, BBC, etc) was:  1. Entirely false to being with 2. Due to Gamma Bias  # 1) entirely false to being with  See here, not only did female leaders, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse:  See here, not only did female leaders do worse than male ones, but even higher female majority parliaments did worse: (correlation more women in parliament = worse outcomes)  In summary:  * The median death per capita rate in female-led countries is 60.3 per million. The median death per capita rate in male-led countries is 17.8 per million (Mann-Whitney U test p-value 0.053). * The median death rate per capita in countries with national parliaments with at least 40% women is 59.7 per million.

And even if it was due to women as a class, that would still make no difference, as you aways judge individuals, not group identity.  The study saying otherwise was absurd in its logical gymnastics to try and paint a false picture:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental\_analysis\_flaws\_underlying\_just\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ie5zng/fundamental_analysis_flaws_underlying_just_about/)  # 2) The reason: due to Gamma bias (useful to know about SJWs)  [https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/](https://malepsychology.org.uk/2018/12/04/why-are-there-so-many-disagreements-about-gender-issues-its-usually-down-to-gamma-bias/)  Within the “celebration” cell, for example, the positive achievements of women are routinely celebrated as a gender issue. Within the same cell in the table, the positive actions and achievements of men are not similarly celebrated or gendered. For example, when a group of boys was recently rescued from dangerous underwater caves in Thailand, it was not reported as a gender issue or as a positive example of masculinity, despite the fact that all the rescuers were male.  In the “victimhood” cell, domestic violence against women, for example, is highlighted as a gender issue, whereas domestic violence against men is played down or completely ignored, despite the [substantial numbers of male victims](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9194-1). When men make up the majority of victims (e.g. suicide, rough sleeping, deaths at work, addiction), the issues are not highlighted or portrayed as gender issues.  Within the “privilege” cell, male privileges are magnified in our media and politics as “patriarchy” whereas female privileges (for example relating to children and family life) are played down or ignored as gender issues.  The overall impact of gamma bias therefore, according to this hypothesis, is that masculinity is made to look significantly worse than it really is whilst simultaneously femininity is made to look significantly better than it really is.  What are the implications of the routine magnifying of the worst of men and minimising the worst of women? Well, for a start we might need to reconceptualise the ‘crisis of masculinity’ as a crisis in our attitudes towards men and masculinity.  Let’s make 2019 the year we wake up to the need to explore our conscious and unconscious biases against men. We hope that the concept of gamma bias and the *gender distortion matrix* will help people to think more clearly about gender issues."

Lee to another name.”  After another question at that press conference, Trump became even more explicit: **“I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.”**  &gt;Oh and Trump offers to pay the legal bills of people to beat up journalists at his rally. Cool.  You mean, ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,""?   So Trump offered to pay the legal fees for someone stopping an attempted assault.    Threatening violence isn't protected speech, so if he did call for violence it would be very easy for a judge to find him guilty in a court of law. Except that hasn't happened.   Meanwhile you had a Bernie Bro shoot a Republican while screaming about taking away healthcare, right after Bernie said that the Republican healthcare program will ""kill people."" And you have an AOC-loving antifa member shoot at and bomb an ICE facility after AOC made her comments about it.

Does something need to be done? Yeah. Sure. And not because we should be because we can. Does any form of international or national government need to control it? Fuck No! They need to get out of the way and let industries do it on their own. Their customers want it...so they are doing it.  Will the drops in green house gasses change the upcoming and basically scheduled global temperature increases? Probably not...my opinion, and some others also.  What more can be done? Expand the use of national gas for all transportation including cars and retrofitting existing vehicles is not expensive and fairly easy to do. Plant more trees and MAKE countries with rain forest stop deforestation.   We can't let the country become like California with its rolling black outs cause they don't have the power stations or infrastructure to handle it, not without cause massive wildfires from 1) poor line management and 2) California becoming so eco friendly that they stopped managing with natural areas with scheduled burns and basic firebreaks.  But many of the scientific stuff you read or listen to say there is much more we can do and my sources say we can do some but let's not ruin an economy, any or many industries, or lower the standard of living.  You can keep posting links as well as I can. Bring information and insight is good for any discussion.   Your link said coal plants are really bad. And they are. One, maybe more of mine say the same but add that many plants have switched over to using natural gas in the last few years. This so much better then using coal or oil.   But the climate nuts cry out that these still put out too much pollution. And they never want to hear how many windmills or solar panels it will take to switch over completely to ""renewable"" sources. Or how long it would take to: build enough of both, manufacture the batteries needed, build the infrastructure for all these massive numbers of panels and mills. They just want it done NOW! Fuck the cost. Fuck the time line. Fuck facts. Just turn it all off NOW!  And of course we can't build anymore nuclear plants or damn anymore rivers, oh hell NO! So while the nuke plants we have get older and no new dams built well be a country completely relying on having enough sun and wind AND the new power lines to move power across the country where there isn't sun or wind for a few days.

Going to submit to all of them online and in print!    \-----  Dear \[insert name of airline\],  There has been a lot of chatter and news articles about requiring a “vaccine” / making a covid shot mandatory for flying (“health passport”). I am writing you to share some thoughts about this.  As a \[insert name of airline\] customer I am horrified that airlines might make a COVID “vaccine” mandatory to fly. A vaccine that uses a new mRNA technology. Untested in the long term &amp; unproven. Larger scale efficacy / safety data was based off testing of only a few months – and in the summer/early fall when immune systems are still strong.  The risk of ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and other mid/long term side effects / harm cannot be ruled out. The adverse reaction rate is also much higher than other ""vaccines.""  Even if there is acceptable safety data in the next two to three years, this is not a reason to require a “vaccine” – which will likely need to be readministered on an annual basis. I’ve attached a CDC past flu vaccine efficacy chart and some shocking disclaimers present on every flu shot warning label, which might make you wonder if the historical flu shot even prevents flu.  Many frequent travelers such as myself have learned how to stay healthy by understanding natural health principles – like flying to sunny places in the winter to get good old fashioned sun for a healthy immune system / Vitamin D.  Taking a shot goes against this idea.  Lastly, we come to COVID itself, which has a 99%+ survivability rate (related to IFR) for those under 70 – per CDC. And \~97%+ for those over 70 and not in a nursing home. While the IFR may change in the future, and while there is a risk of “long covid” for some, choosing whether to get an (annual) shot must remain a choice, not a requirement.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.  \---  IFR rate is on this CDC webpage – right most box   [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1)   Did diseases decline because of vaccines?

The problem with it is that classifying things in an A vs B groups manner is significantly detrimental to the actual debate and logical discussion which SHOULD occur on topics of a political nature.)  You are allowed to criticize Hillary Clinton without causing “chaos.”  Good lord, you brought Russia into it.    It is important to note that **she** was classifying people as “A vs B.”  **She**, a nomimee for President of the United States.  The person you were replying to was pointing out that making people into “A vs B” groups is **dangerous**.  I think you’d agree with that.  Now that you’ve finally listened to her say it - I have a question:  Did **HER words** sound “Confrontational in perfect alignment with the verified goal of chaos and obstruction as part of russian foreign policy” ???  (Seems to me they did)  Was Hillary a tool of Russian foreign policy?  Im not being facetious when I say that your explantion is making me think perhaps she **was**.  Perhaps unwittingly.  [Perhaps even **purposefully**.](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration) (link shows strange recent investigative findings on the matter)  &gt;	4 Devoid of any actual relevant content to the topic of gun control itself. Intentionally inflammatory in the A vs B manner described above.  The topic was about people being labeled as part of an “undersirable group,” by government authorities, and having them disarmed.  It was about how that can happen here.    Listen to the audio of Hillary.  She was placing about 1/2 the country in an “undesirable group” (“deplorables”).  She was **the** flag bearer of a Party that has finally revealed that it is hellbent on seizing guns.  The “deplorables” Are disproportionally pro-gun, and gun owners.  The reference to Hillary Clinton was apt.  &gt;	Edit: Also curious, what statement are you referencing? Please link.
